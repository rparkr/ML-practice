        "Vehicle origin information comes from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which requires that every automaker publicly post information regarding the percentage of vehicle components (by value, not quantity) and labor from the United States and Canada, and, if applicable, from the next two most prevalent countries. See the **[Data Sources](#scrollTo=Data_Collection_Vehicle_Info)** section in the intro.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the code below, I use RegEx (regular expressions) to evaluate whether the Origin dataset has information for a particular model in the `models` dictionary. `pandas` provides faster methods for looking for values, like [`'value' in df['col']`](https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-check-if-a-value-exists-in-a-pandas-dataframe-in-python), or [`df['col'].isin(['value'])`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#indexing-with-isin), and even methods for combining data automatically, like `df.join()` or `df.merge()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason I use the slower RegEx method is that the models and makes are occassionally listed differently across the two datasets. The `models` dictionary tends to have the full model and make names, and the Origin datasets usually have shorter versions of the full model names. For example, I would like `Silverado` in the Origin dataset to match `Silverado 1500` and `Silverado HD` in the `models` dictionary. Thus, I use RegEx to check each Origin model to see if it has a match in the `models` dictionary.\n"
