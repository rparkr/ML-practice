48239,Celestial sphere,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_sphere&action=info,"In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an abstract sphere that has an arbitrarily large radius and is concentric to Earth. All objects in the sky can be conceived as being projected upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere, which may be centered on Earth or the observer. If centered on the observer, half of the sphere would resemble a hemispherical screen over the observing location.


The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing astronomers to specify the apparent positions of objects in the sky if their distances are unknown or irrelevant. In the equatorial coordinate system, the celestial equator divides the celestial sphere into two halves: the northern and southern celestial hemispheres.


Because astronomical objects are at such remote distances, casual observation of the sky offers no information on their actual distances. All celestial objects seem equally far away, as if fixed onto the inside of a sphere with a large but unknown radius, 
which appears to rotate westward overhead; meanwhile, Earth underfoot seems to remain still. For purposes of spherical astronomy, which is concerned only with the directions to celestial objects, it makes no difference if this is actually the case or if it is Earth that is rotating while the celestial sphere is stationary.


The celestial sphere can be considered to be infinite in radius. This means any point within it, including that occupied by the observer, can be considered the center. It also means that all parallel lines, be they millimetres apart or across the Solar System from each other, will seem to intersect the sphere at a single point, analogous to the vanishing point of graphical perspective. 
All parallel planes will seem to intersect the sphere in a coincident great circle 
(a ""vanishing circle"").


Conversely, observers looking toward the same point on an infinite-radius celestial sphere will be looking along parallel lines, and observers looking toward the same great circle, along parallel planes. On an infinite-radius celestial sphere, all observers see the same things in the same direction.


For some objects, this is over-simplified. Objects which are relatively near to the observer (for instance, the Moon) will seem to change position against the distant celestial sphere if the observer moves far enough, say, from one side of planet Earth to the other. This effect, known as parallax, can be represented as a small offset from a mean position. The celestial sphere can be considered to be centered at the Earth's center, the Sun's center, or any other convenient location, and offsets from positions referred to these centers can be calculated.


In this way, astronomers can predict geocentric or heliocentric positions of objects on the celestial sphere, without the need to calculate the individual geometry of any particular observer, and the utility of the celestial sphere is maintained. Individual observers can work out their own small offsets from the mean positions, if necessary. In many cases in astronomy, the offsets are insignificant.


The celestial sphere can thus be thought of as a kind of astronomical shorthand, and is applied very frequently by astronomers. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the Moon on January 1 at 00:00:00.00 Terrestrial Time, in equatorial coordinates, as right ascension 6h 57m 48.86s, declination +23Â° 30' 05.5"". Implied in this position is that it is as projected onto the celestial sphere; any observer at any location looking in that direction would see the ""geocentric Moon"" in the same place against the stars. For many rough uses (e.g. calculating an approximate phase of the Moon), this position, as seen from the Earth's center, is adequate.


For applications requiring precision (e.g. calculating the shadow path of an eclipse), the Almanac gives formulae and methods for calculating the topocentric coordinates, that is, as seen from a particular place on the Earth's surface, based on the geocentric position. This greatly abbreviates the amount of detail necessary in such almanacs, as each observer can handle their own specific circumstances.


Celestial spheres (or celestial orbs) were envisioned to be perfect and divine entities initially from Greek astronomers such as Aristotle (384 B.C to 322 B.C). The Greek philosopher, Aristotle, composed a set of principles called Aristotelian physics that outlined the natural order and structure of the world. Like other Greek astronomers, Aristotle also thought the ""...celestial sphere as the frame of reference for their geometric theories of the motions of the heavenly bodies""(Olser, pg. 14). With Aristotle's adoption of Eudoxus' theory, Aristotle had described celestial bodies within the Celestial sphere to be filled with pureness, perfect and quintessence (the fifth element that was known to be divine and purity according to Aristotle). Significantly, Aristotle deemed the Sun, Moon, planets and the fixed stars to be perfectly concentric spheres that is divided into two regions; the sublunary region, and the superlunary region. Aristotle had asserted that these bodies (in the superlunary region) are perfect and cannot be corrupted by any of the four elements; fire, water, air, and earth. Corruptible elements were only contained in the sublunary region and incorruptible elements were in the superlunary region of Aristotle's geocentric model. Aristotle had the notion the behavior of celestial orbs must move in celestial motion (a perfect circular motion) that goes on for eternity. He also argued that the behavior and property follows strictly to a principle of natural place where the quintessence element only moves freely of divine will while other elements; fire, air, water and earth are corruptible to change and imperfection. Aristotle's key concepts rely on the nature of the five elements distinguishing the Earth and the Heavens in the astronomical reality with applying Eudoxus' model to define the spheres to be physically real.


Numerous discoveries from Aristotle and Eudoxus (approximately 395 B.C. to 337 B.C.) have sparked differences in both of their models and sharing similar properties simultaneously. Aristotle and Eudoxus claimed two different counts of spheres in the heavens. According to Eudoxus, there were only 27 spheres in the heavens while there are 55 spheres in Aristotle's model. Eudoxus attempts to mathematically construct his model from a treatise known as On the velocities (translated from Greek to English) and asserted the shape of the hippopede or lemniscate to be associated with the planetary retrogression. Aristotle emphasized the speed of the celestial orbs are unchanging like the heavens while Eudoxus emphasizes that the orbs are in a perfect geometrical shape. Eudoxus 's spheres would produce undesirable motions to the lower region of the planets while Aristotle introduced unrollers between each set of active spheres to counteract the motions of the outer set, or else the outer motions will be transferred to the outer planets. Aristotle would later observe ""..the motions of the planets by using the combinations of nested spheres and circular motions in creative ways, but further observations kept undoing their work"" (Olser pg. 15).


Aside from Aristotle and Eudoxus, Empedocles gives an explanation that the motion of the heavens, moving about it at divine (relatively high) speed that puts Earth in a stationary position due to the circular motion preventing the downward movement from natural causes. Aristotle criticized Empedocles' case as he argued that all heavy objects go towards Earth and not the whirl itself coming to Earth. He ridiculed and claimed the Empedocles' statement to be extremely absurd. Anything that defies the motion of natural place and the unchanging heavens (including the celestial spheres would be immediately be criticized from Aristotle).


These concepts are important for understanding celestial coordinate systems, frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth's equator, axis, and orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the celestial equator, the north and south celestial poles, and the ecliptic, respectively. As the celestial sphere is considered arbitrary or infinite in radius, all observers see the celestial equator, celestial poles, and ecliptic at the same place against the background stars.


From these bases, directions toward objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to geographic longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system specifies positions relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The ecliptic coordinate system specifies positions relative to the ecliptic (Earth's orbit), using ecliptic longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other celestial coordinate systems, like the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.


The ancients assumed the literal truth of stars attached to a celestial sphere, revolving about the Earth in one day, and a fixed Earth. 
The Eudoxan planetary model, on which the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic models were based, was the first geometric explanation for the ""wandering"" of the classical planets. The outermost of these ""crystal spheres"" was thought to carry the fixed stars. Eudoxus used 27 concentric spherical solids to answer Plato's challenge: ""By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?""


A celestial sphere can also refer to a physical model of the celestial sphere or celestial globe.
Such globes map the constellations on the outside of a sphere, resulting in a mirror image of the constellations as seen from Earth. The oldest surviving example of such an artifact is the globe of the Farnese Atlas sculpture, a 2nd-century copy of an older (Hellenistic period, ca. 120 BCE) work.


Observers on other worlds would, of course, see objects in that sky under much the same conditions â as if projected onto a dome. Coordinate systems based on the sky of that world could be constructed. These could be based on the equivalent ""ecliptic"", poles and equator, although the reasons for building a system that way are as much historic as technical.",5,8 April 2002, 7 September 2021,361,1,1

Skerry played collegiate basketball at Tufts University where he set the school record for career assists (634) and single-season assists (198).


After graduation, Skerry joined his alma mater's coaching staff, where he spent three seasons before moving on to Stonehill College for the 1995â96 season. A year later he took his first head coaching job at Curry College at the age of 26. In two seasons at the helm of the Colonials, Skerry compiled a 24â25 record.


In 1998, Skerry jumped to Northeastern University as an assistant coach for two seasons, before moving on to William & Mary (2000â03), College of Charleston (2003â05), University of Rhode Island (2005â08), Providence College (2008â10), and Pittsburgh (2010â11) before accepting the head coaching job at Towson, replacing Pat Kennedy.


Skerry's first season in charge of the Tigers saw the team go 1â31, with the lone win coming on January 28, 2012 against UNC-Wilmington, snapping the team's NCAA record 41-game losing streak. One year later, Towson went 18â13, finishing second in the Colonial Athletic Association completing the biggest single season improvement in NCAA basketball history. Despite the high finish, the Tigers were ineligible for the CAA Tournament and NCAA Tournament due to low APR scores that were earned under the previous coach, Pat Kennedy.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Estonia had hoped for the return of more than 2,000 square kilometers of territory annexed by Russia after World War II in 1945. The annexed land with Russian majority had been within the borders Estonia and Russia agreed on in the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. However, the Boris Yeltsin government disavowed any responsibility for acts committed by the Soviet Union.


After the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the October Revolution, territorial delineation between Soviet Russia and the newly independent Estonia was determined by the 1920 Tartu peace treaty. On the onset of World War II, Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in the form of the Estonian SSR, as part of the overall occupation of the Baltic States. Soon it was overtaken by the Nazi Germany and re-occupied by the Soviet Union for the period of 1944â1991.


After Estonia regained its independence from the Soviet Union following the Singing Revolution, Estonian and Russian negotiators reached a technical agreement on the EstoniaâRussia border in December 1996, with the border remaining substantially the same as the one drawn by Joseph Stalin, with some minor adjustments. The border treaty was initialed in 1999. On 18 May 2005 Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov signed in Moscow the âTreaty between the Government of the Republic of Estonia and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Estonian-Russian borderâ and the âTreaty between the Government of the Republic of Estonia and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Delimitation of the Maritime Zones in the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Narvaâ. The Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament) ratified the treaties on 20 June 2005, with a reference to the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty in the preamble of the ratification law, placing the new border treaty in context of internal Estonian law as amending the original 1920 border, objected by Russia. The President of Estonia, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel proclaimed the treaties on 22 June 2005. As the preamble of the ratification act mentioned the 1920 Tartu peace treaty, Russia interpreted this as in theory giving Estonia a right to claim some territories of Pskov and Leningrad Oblast of Russia later.  As proposed by the Russian Government on 13 August 2005, on 31 August 2005 Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a written order to the Russian Foreign Ministry to notify the Estonian side of âRussiaâs intention not to participate in the border treaties between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estoniaâ. On 6 September 2005, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation sent Estonia a note, in which Russia informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaties between Estonia and Russia and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaties. Negotiations were reopened in 2012 and the Treaty was signed in February 2014. Ratification is pending on both sides, with some Estonian MPs and officials opposing the ratification of the treaty. Their position is that this treaty contradicts the 1920 treaty and all decisions of the Estonian SSR were declared invalid in 1991.",0,25 January 2017, 7 August 2021,18,0,0

He is best known for his poems, both the satirical ones and his love poems. He worked as a school teacher for some years, but most of his life he worked as a sheep farmer and a labourer.


Poul F.'s work include translated poems by Heinrich Heine and Robert Burns. His first collection of poems Gaman og Ã¡lvara (Novelty and severity) was published in 1924; it was the second collection of poetry by a Faroese poet published in the Faroe Islands. It was published by FelagiÃ° VarÃ°in with Richard Long. The first collection of poems in the Faroese language was published in 1914, these poems were written by Janus Djurhuus, the title was Yrkingar which means Poems. He was awarded with the Faroese Literature Prize in 1963.


Poul (PÃ³l) F. Joensen was the son of Daniel Jacob Joensen from HÃ¸rg, Sumba and Anna Sofia, born Langaard, both came from the village of Sumba. Later he married Julia Mortensen from FroÃ°ba.


When Poul F. was 14 years old he tried to become a seaman as did many of his friends. He was a fisherman for one year. He wished to continue with life at sea and had plans to go fishing aboard the fishing vessel Robert Miller, but his parents wouldn't permit him to do so. Instead they sent him to TÃ³rshavn, to study to become a teacher in public schools. Later it turned out that if he had gone fishing on Robert Miller on that trip, it would have been the last thing that he did, and no one would have known about his poetry ever. Robert Miller never returned from that trip in March 1914, and all the men onboard lost their lives. Poul F. Joensen graduated as a school teacher in 1917. He was teaching from 1919â27 in FroÃ°ba and again 1947â49 in Lopra; both villages are on SuÃ°uroy. After teaching for eight years he decided to give up teaching and live as a writer and a sheep farmer and by working various jobs.


The Faroese singer and composer Hanus G. Johansen has released two albums with poems by Poul F. Joensen. The first album, Gaman og Ã¡lvara was released in 1988, the second in 2012. Gaman og Ã¡lvara was first released as a vinyl LP and cassette, but some years later in 2008 it was released as a CD.


On 17 June 2007 a memorial stone was erected in FroÃ°ba by Lions Club SuÃ°uroy, near his home. The stone was taken from a hillside in Sumba, the village where he was born and grew up. A metal plate with a portrait of Poul F. Joensen was placed on the stone, made by Nordisk Metalkunst of Kalsing in Denmark. Ãrni Ziska made the text and put the plate into place.

Bote attended Erie High School in Erie, Colorado as a freshman and later transferred to Faith Christian Academy in Arvada, Colorado. As a senior in 2011, Bote led Faith Christian to the 3A Colorado state title in baseball. Bote enrolled at Liberty University to play college baseball as a walk-on, but after a semester, transferred to Neosho County Community College in Kansas. During his lone collegiate season, he hit .419. He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 18th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.


After Bote signed with the Cubs for $100,000 plus college tuition, he was assigned to the Arizona League Cubs where he batted .232 with one home run, 14 RBIs and seven doubles in 38 games. He spent 2013 with the Daytona Cubs, Kane County Cougars, and Boise Hawks, posting a combined .227 batting average with seven home runs and 38 RBIs in 90 total games between the three teams, and 2014 with Kane County, Boise, and the Iowa Cubs, compiling a combined .235 batting average with four home runs and 40 RBIs in 99 games. In 2015, he played for the South Bend Cubs where he slashed .251/.328/384 with six home runs and 41 RBIs, and in 2016, he spent time with Iowa, the Tennessee Smokies, and the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, batting a combined .328 with seven home runs and 45 RBIs with an .892 OPS.


In 2017, Bote played for the Tennessee Smokies where he was named a Southern League All-Star. After the season, he played in the Arizona Fall League and was selected to play in the Fall Stars Game. The Cubs added him to their 40-man roster after the season. In the minor leagues, Bote had played at every position except catcher.


Bote made his major league debut on April 21, 2018, taking the place of Ben Zobrist who was placed on the disabled list. Bote filled in for a week at third for an injured Kris Bryant. He had 19 at bats with five hits, five RBIs, one stolen base and a batting average of .263 before being sent back to the Iowa Cubs. On July 26, 2018, Bote hit a game-tying, two-run home run with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning against Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Brad Boxberger, which was immediately followed by a walk-off solo home run by teammate Anthony Rizzo. On August 12, 2018, Bote hit a pinch hit, two-out, two-strike 9th inning walk-off grand slam off Washington Nationals pitcher Ryan Madson to give his team a one-run victory, which had not been done since Roger Freed in 1979, giving the Cubs a 4â3 victory and a two-out-of-three series win, marking the second time in Major League Baseball history that a player hit a walk-off grand slam to win by a score of 4â3. On August 24, 2018, Bote hit his 2nd career walk-off home run off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Raisel Iglesias. The Cubs won that game 3â2.


On April 3, 2019, Bote signed a 5-year, $15 million extension with the Cubs. He recorded his third walk-off hit, a single off of Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Archie Bradley on April 21, 2019. On June 5, Bote had a four-hit, seven RBI game in a 9â8 win against the Colorado Rockies. He finished the 2019 season slashing .257/.362/.422 with 11 home runs and 41 RBIs over 127 games.


In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, Bote slashed .200/.303/.408 with 7 home runs and 29 RBIs in 45 games.

42128532,"Embassy of Israel, Manila","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_Israel,_Manila","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Embassy_of_Israel,_Manila&action=info","The Embassy of the State of Israel in the Philippines is at the 11th Floor of Avecshares Center, 1132 University Parkway North, Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. The Israelâs permanent mission in the Philippines has been representing the country since the year 1962.


The current ambassador of Israel to the Philippines is Ambassador Rafael Harpaz. 


When Adolf Hitler became the chancellor of Germany in January 1933, he initiated the killing of almost six million Jews.


More than a thousand of German and Austrian Jews escaped to the Philippines when no other country accepted them. The rescue strategy was decided while playing cards and smoking cigars by three men: President Manuel L. Quezon, Paul McNutt and Frieder family. President Quezon opened the country's doors to the fleeing refugees as ""it was the right thing to do"". McNutt, who was the American High Commissioner to the Philippines, jeopardized his career as he persuaded the US government to issue thousands of working visas for the Jews, while the Frieder brothers, provided jobs in their own cigar factory. He and his brothers also raised money for the Jews' transport to Manila and established shelters and schools.


In 1947, the Philippines was one of the 33 countries and the only Asian country who voted for the UN Resolution 181 referring to the  partition of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. A Treaty of Friendship was signed on February 26, 1958 indicating full diplomatic relations between the two nations. The Philippine and Israel embassies were both opened in 1962, in Manila and Tel Aviv respectively. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by both countries in 1997, establishing bilateral ties in economy, education, trade, science, and tourism.


The good relations and cooperation between the State of Israel and the Republic of the Philippines is continuously growing. Various agreements between the countries have been signed and are being operated. The most recently signed agreement is the âAir Service Agreementâ in which the number of flights was increased. The agreement also enabled Tel Aviv to be a stopover point on flights to Europe.


 Investors from Israel consider the Philippines as a viable investment site and are promoting the country as the best in Southeast Asia. Among the Israeli companies that invested in the Philippines are Amdocs Limited, ECI Telecom LTD and Vishay Intertechnology have already invested in the Philippines. Currently, there are about $200 million worth of bilateral contracts between the two countries. The Israel Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, meanwhile, would like to focus more on tourism and plans to triple the bilateral contracts in the coming years.


The strong cultural relation between the two countries can be seen in the different events and activities organized by the embassy. Some of the major events annually promoted by the embassy are the Israeli Film Festival (every fourth quarter of the year); the National Day of Israel held (every second quarter of the year); participation to the Philippine International Jazz and Arts Festival. The embassy has also brought Israeli artists to the Philippines such as the director Tomer Heymann; choreographer Ido Tadmor; musicians Guy Mentesh and Yahel Doron.


As of 2013, an estimated number of 31,000 Filipinos are residing in Israel.  Most of the Filipino migrants work as caregivers while a small portion works in hotels and restaurants. However, despite the close association of Filipinos being caregivers in Israel, Rose âOsangâ Fostanes proved that Filipinos are talented and have so much in store. Osang came to Israel in 2008 to work as a caregiver. After six years of residing to the country, on January 14 of 2014, she won the first season of âX-Factor Israelâ âthis became possible with the enormous support given to her by the people of Israel. Furthermore, two documentary films focusing on Filipino workers based in Israel were shown in the Philippines and Israel âTransit and Paperdolls.âTransitâ (2013) is a Philippine independent film about the challenges of Filipino families living outside the country, as well as the dilemma of identities of two Filipino children living in Israel. On the other hand, the film âPaperdollsâ (2006) is a documentary film by Tomer Heymann, an Israeli award-winning filmmaker. The film is about a community of transvestite Filipinos who make a living in Israel as live-in care givers 6 days a week and as a group of drag performers on their free night âin which they are called âthe paperdollsâ.


In November 2013, the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in history, typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines. The Israeli government, after hearing the devastating news, immediately sent a team of 148-member from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) assisted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  The government also reconstructed buildings, restored water supply, and set up a field hospital to provide immediate medical response such as delivery of babies, perform surgeries and treatment of more than 2,800 victims. They also conducted search and rescue operations and sent relief goods for the people affected by the disaster. Numerous organizations and institutions from Israel likewise helped the victims of the typhoon such as IsraAID (Israel forum for international Humanitarian Aid), Boys town Jerusalem, Israeli Relief Coalition and other volunteers from Israel has sent medical assistance to the victims.


MASHAV is Israel's international development cooperation program. It was launched in 1957 with the purpose of spreading knowledge and related technologies which helped in the country's rapid development. The programs which Mashav prioritize today include poverty alleviation, empowerment of women, education services, assistance in agricultural methods, and other humanitarian projects. Since its establishment, the program has trained close to 270,000 course participants from 132 countries âincluding the Philippines.


Various  MASHAV courses are being offered in the Philippines. Recently, the program offered new courses for the country which includes: International Training on Clean Technologies, Course on Developing and Organizing a Trauma System and MCS Organization, Feeding the Future: Food Safety and Technology in times of Global Change and Commercial Beekeeping in Modern Agriculture. Moreover, the program keeps its contacts with former course applicants for them to be part of the â Shalom Clubâ âit serves as forum for all MASHAV alumni. There are over 70 shalom clubs worldwide in which the members are encouraged to participate in social and professional activities, to attend fund-raising events, lectures ranging from AIDS education and business management and exchange ideas about a certain issue. The embassy of Israel in Manila is a partner of the Shalom Club in the Philippines. Their goal is to seek human and sustainable development, as well as to improve bilateral relations of the two countries. The main activities conducted by the club are feeding programs and donation missions.


The Center for International Cooperation (MASHAV) and the Center for International Agricultural Development Cooperation (CINADCO) of Israel, together with Central Luzon State University (CLSU), Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), and Nueva Ecija Provincial Government of Philippines formed the PICAT Project on June 19, 2006. Its main purpose is to establish an agricultural training center that would stimulate better farm productivity, sustainability and profitability for the families in the region of Nueva Ecija, and then was launched in other provinces such as Bulacan, Tarlac, and Pampanga.",1,5 February 2014, 26 May 2021,86,0,0

Shanks legally changed his name to Mike the Mover in 1990 to help promote his furniture moving business.


According to Mover, he has run for public office more than 17 times but has never been elected.


Though originally motivated to run for office in order to draw attention to Washington's complex regulations for movers, Mover's more recent campaigns have been a marketing tactic to promote his business. In 2004 he estimated $150,000 of his company's annual revenue came from name familiarity generated by his ballot appearances. Never endorsed by a political party, he has sought office as both a Democrat and a Republican. In the 2014 election for U.S. Congress from Washington's 1st congressional district, Mover, a Civil War enthusiast, ran as a candidate of the ""National Union Party"" (under Washington elections law, candidates can declare themselves a member of any party, whether the party exists or not). Changing his name again to Uncle Mover, Mover filed to run for U.S. Senate in 2016.


Mike the Mover grew up as one of twelve children born to Richard and Patricia Shanks. His father was the former Mayor of Lake City prior to it becoming part of Seattle in the 1950s.


Mover resides in Snohomish County near Lynnwood, Washington.


In 1977, Mover started moving professionally. Unable to receive a state permit, he was charged 89 times with gross misdemeanors and was convicted of in two of these cases for operating an illegal moving business.",2,13 May 2014, 2 March 2021,48,0,0

5390252,Executive search,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_search,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_search&action=info,"Executive search (informally called headhunting) is a specialized recruitment service which organizations pay to seek out and recruit highly qualified candidates for senior-level and executive jobs across the public and private sectors, as well as non-profit organizations (e.g., President, Vice-president, CEO, and non-executive-directors.)Headhunters may also seek out and recruit other highly specialized and/or skilled positions in organizations for which there is strong competition in the job market for the top talent, such as senior data analysts or computer programmers.


The method usually involves commissioning a third-party organization, typically an executive search firm, but possibly a standalone consultant or consulting firm, to research the availability of suitable qualified candidates working for competitors or related businesses or organizations. Having identified a shortlist of qualified candidates who match the client's requirements, the executive search firm may act as an intermediary to contact the individual(s) and see if they might be interested in moving to a new employer. The executive search firm may also carry out initial screening of the candidate, negotiations on remuneration and benefits, and preparing the employment contract.


In some markets, there has been a move towards using executive search for lower positions, driven by the fact that there are fewer candidates for some positions, even on lower levels than executive.


An executive search firm is a type of professional service firm that specializes in recruiting executives and other senior personnel for their client companies in various industries. Executive search agents/professionals typically have a wide range of personal contacts in their industry or field of specialty; detailed, specific knowledge of the area; and typically operate at the most senior level of executive positions. Executive search professionals are also involved throughout the hiring process, conducting detailed interviews and presenting candidates to clients selectively, when they feel the candidate meets all stated requirements and would fit into the culture of the hiring firm. Executive search firms typically have long-lasting relationships with clients spanning many years, and in such cases the suitability of candidates is paramount. It is also important that such firms operate with a high level of professionalism and confidentiality.


When corporate entities elect to use an outside executive search firm, it is usually because they lack the internal research resources, professional networks, or evaluative skills to properly recruit for themselves. Using an outside firm also allows the corporate entity the freedom of recruiting from competitors without doing so directly, and the ability to choose among candidates that would not be available through internal or passive sourcing methodologies. Executive search firms are national and international. Many specialize in a particular business industry sector. The contractual relationship between client and executive search firm falls into two broad categories: contingent and retained. Contingent recruiters are paid only upon the successful completion of the ""search assignment."" Retained recruiters are paid for the process, typically earning a recruiting fee in three stages based on the anticipated compensation of the executive.


In 1959 the Association of Executive Search and Leadership Consultants (AESC) emerged to set the standards of quality and ethics for the executive search consulting trade. AESC Members range in size from large global firms and networks to boutique firms spanning more than 70 countries.


High-end executive search firms get a retainer (up-front fee) to perform a specific search for a corporate officer or other senior executive position. Typically, retained searches tend to be for positions that pay upwards of US$150,000 and often far more. Search fees are typically 33.33% of the annual compensation of the recruited executive.[citation needed] Fee payments may be made in thirds, 1/3 of fee paid on initiation of the search, 1/3 paid thirty days later, and the final 1/3 paid thirty days later or upon placement of the candidate. Alternatively, a fixed fee may be established.


Retained search firms provide a guarantee to do an assignment over if the hired candidate leaves before a stated milestone (anywhere from one year to three years), generally with the caveat there has not been a material change in the position requirements or management team.[citation needed] In a retained search, the fee is for the time and expertise of the search firm. The firm is employed to conduct the entire recruitment effort from startup until the candidate has started working.[citation needed] There are many considerations taken into account when organizations determine whether to hire a retained or other type of search firm, including time and financial resources available, goals of the position search (such as diversity factors), and the importance of discretion and confidentiality.


Retained recruiters work for the organizations who are their clients, not for job candidates seeking employment, in some countries, such as the UK, recruiters are not legally permitted to charge candidates.  In the U.S. job candidates may pay an up front retainer to a consulting or career counseling firms to assist them in their job search.  Search firms generally commit to ""off-limits"" agreements.  These agreements prevent a firm from approaching employees of their current clients as candidates for other clients (for instance, if a headhunter recruits the new CEO into Boeing, they will agree not to recommend Boeing executives to other companies). Since they act as management consultants working in the best interests of the clients for whom they conduct searches, it would be counterproductive to simultaneously remove talented executives from those client companies. Search firms may decline assignments from certain companies, in order to preserve their ability to recruit candidates from those companies. Some large search firms may insist on guarantees of a certain number or dollar value of searches before they will put an entire company ""off-limits"".


Another form of high-end executive search, delimited or engaged search, is often improperly categorized as retained search, although there are distinct differences. Similar to retained search firms, delimited/engaged search firms require an up-front fee before engaging the search. Unlike a conventional retainer, however, the delimited/engaged search commitment fee is refundable if the recruiter fails to achieve a hire or other deliverable specified in the contract. Moreover, the delimited/engaged search commitment fee does not follow the typical 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 model of retainers, but rather is a relatively small up-front fee which is discounted from the final placement fee of 25â35% of the successful candidate's first year compensation. Both retained and delimited/engaged searches involve partial payment prior to filling the job, and the contracted recruiter has the search exclusively. Therefore, the search can be customized to the client organization's needs, with the search professional providing a consultative service throughout the process. While both retained and delimited/engaged searches serve client employers rather than job-seeking executives, delimited/engaged search contracts always (as opposed to sometimes) state a future date when the project must be completed or the downpayment refunded.


As stated, contingent search firms are remunerated only upon the successful completion of the searchâtypically when the candidate accepts the position. These recruiters may earn from 20% to 35% of the candidate's first-year base salary or total remuneration as a hiring fee; the fee may also be calculated to include the candidate's (that is, the successful hire's) median or expected first-year bonus payout. In any case, the fee is (as always) paid by the hiring company, not the candidate/hire. Contingent firms in some markets may quote fees in the range of 12% to 20% as well.


Clients (companies seeking to hire) often tend to work with contingent search firms when filling mid-level positions. As contingent search firms generally rely heavily on their contacts, and seldom work on an exclusive basis, it is not rare for a client to work with a large number of contingent recruiters on the same search at the same time, in order to maximize the volume of candidate (job seeker) resumes they receive. Beyond the increased volume of candidates that such an approach allows, contingent firms do not get paid until the placement is made (a candidate is successfully hired), and thus the search risk is shifted almost entirely to the search firms. Moreover, contingent search firms often work with clients on higher percentage fee basis, relative to retained and delimited search firms as they shoulder more risk. For senior level roles, clients often prefer to work with recruiters who have performed well in the past for them and usually will end up in the hands of a retained or delimited recruiter.  By working exclusively with one firm on such searches, the client generally develops a much deeper relationship with the recruiter, and receives a much higher level of service. With all methods, retained, delimited, and contingency, clients rely on search professionals to provide not just resumes, but also insightful, consultative information about the market in general.


A delimited search is often preferred by clients who are seeking a retainer-style service level, while not willing to accept the level of risk that retained search entails. While delimited search does entail up-front fees, they tend to be much smaller than total pre-placement fees that retained search entails. Moreover, delimited search professionals shoulder the risk of their own failure to execute the search within a specified timeframe, offering to refund the up-front fees in such an event. While delimited search is not as desirable for searches that are open-ended in nature, the ""ticking clock"" is often seen by clients as an incentive that motivates delimited search recruiters to stay more active and involved throughout the hiring process.",5,2 June 2006, 17 July 2021,504,0,0

The plant is notable for being one of the first in the U.S. built to a 1500 Volt system specification.  The electricity is being sold to the Platte River Power Authority (PRPA) under a 25-year power purchase agreement.


The plant occupies about 190 acres (77Â ha) distributed adjacent to PRPA's natural gas and coal-fired Rawhide Energy Station.  It uses 117,120 polycrystalline silicon panels (Model SN-72cell: rated ~310Â Wp, ~16% efficiency, 1500Â Vdc isolation) that the manufacturer, S-Energy, claims are less susceptible to potential-induced degradation.
The panels are mounted in rows onto single-axis trackers. The rows are organized into 12 blocks, and the electricity produced from each block is connected to the electric grid through a  Samurai Series 1500Â Vdc, 2700Â kWÂ /Â 2700Â kVA  inverter built by TMEIC.  The boost in system voltage from the previous 1.0Â kV standard to 1.5Â kV enables the inverter to operate at higher efficiency and reliability, and is expected to reduce overall balance of system costs over the lifetime of the facility.


The project was developed, constructed, and continues to be operated by Boulder-based juwi Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the German renewable energy company juwi AG.  Construction began in February 2016, and commercial operation began in October 2016.  The project was financed and is owned by PSEG Solar Source, a subsidiary of New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group.  The completed facility cost about US$54Â million.


On February 14, 2019 PRPA announced that it entered an agreement to add another 20Â MW of solar photovoltaic generating capacity at the site, anticipated to be online in early 2020.    The addition will include 2Â MW of lithium-ion battery storage.",1,18 February 2019, 24 January 2021,15,0,0

11627567,Old Canberra Inn,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Canberra_Inn,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_Canberra_Inn&action=info,"The Old Canberra Inn is one of the earliest licensed pubs in the Canberra region, Australia. The building pre-dates the city itself. It is located in the present day suburb of Lyneham.


The original slab hut was built in 1857 by Joseph Schumack and in 1876 it was licensed as an inn.  It was a coach stop on the Yass to Queanbeyan run until 1887 when it was sold to John Read.  It became the Read family home until 1974, called The Pines until it was renovated and relicensed as the Old Canberra Inn.


The Old Canberra Inn is well known for its craft beers, with their 8 beer taps exclusively serving craft beer.


Joseph Shumack (1836-1901) built the ""Old Canberra Inn"" in 1857. He was born in Ireland in 1836 and migrated to Australia in 1841 at the age of 5 with his parents John Schmack (1812-1849) and Margaret OâToole. They were part of the Shumack family who are credited with making substantial contributions to the development of Canberra. The most famous member of this family was Samuel Shumack who was Josephâs cousin.


In 1842 Josephâs father acquired Glebe Farm which was on the western boundary of Duntroon with a frontage to the Molonglo River. He lived here with his family until 1849 when he died suddenly leaving his wife Margaret to care for four young children the oldest of whom was Joseph who was 13 at that time. They continued farming the land and then in 1854 his mother married Edward Woods who was also a widower.


In 1856 Joseph was granted his own 100 acre lot at the site of the ""Old Canberra Inn"". A map is shown illustrating its location. He built a house and began farming. He seems to have acquired one of the other adjacent 100 acre lots as in 1877 a traveller described the property in the following terms.


In 1865 Joseph married Bridget Mary Ward (1836-1914) who came from County Cork, Ireland. The couple had four children.


From the late 1850s many new coach services started running through Yass and Ginninderra through to Queanbeyan and Braidwood. As the map shows Josephâs house was ideally positioned next to the Yass to Queanbeyan Road so in 1876 he decided to take advantage of his location and converted his residence to the ""Canberra Inn"" and obtained a liquor licence. The Inn became a regular stop for the Yass/ Queanbeyan mail coach and the coaches en route to the Araluen Goldfields.


In 1887 he decided to sell his property and advertised it in the newspapers. The advertisement is shown. At this time the Old Canberra Inn was described in the following terms.


The house was bought by Josephâs nephew John Read.


John Read (1868-1917) who bought the Old Canberra Inn in 1887 converted it back to a residence and called it ""The Pines"".  The Read family lived there for almost ninety years. John Read was born in 1868 in Canberra. His father was Hugh Read (1838-1894) who arrived in Australia in 1856 at the age of 18. Hugh worked for Joseph Shumack and in 1862 he married Josephâs sister Eliza Shumack. The couple had ten children and settled on a property called ""Wattle Grove"" at Sutton.


In 1895, eight years after he bought the Canberra Inn, John Read married Ellen Maloney (1871-1962). She was the daughter of Robert Maloney who owned one of the 100 acre lots shown in the map above that was almost adjacent to the Old Canberra Inn.


The couple had six children. Three of them are shown in the photo of 1910 standing outside their home ""the Pines"" formerly the Canberra Inn. They are Eileen, Jack and Harry. It seems that the Read family continued to operate the property as a farm as in 1898 John won a prize at the Agricultural show for his oat crop.


John died in 1917 and Ellen his wife continued to live at ""The Pines"". The Electoral Rolls show that she lived at the house for the rest of her life. She died in 1962 at the age of 90. Her sons Robert and Thomas also lived with her intermittently during that time and helped her with the farm. Three of her other four children settled in the Canberra district. Jack Read who is shown in the above photo built Strathnairn Homestead in 1924. He later owned the Royal Hotel in Braidwood.


After Ellen died in 1962 her two sons Robert and Thomas continued to live at ""The Pines"". Robert died in 1966 and Thomas died in 1973. In 1974 it was bought by the Government who decided to restore it and convert it to an inn.

She operated in the Pacific Ocean until she was destroyed by Typhoon Louise off Okinawa, 9 October 1945.


Snowbell (AN-52) was laid down on 3 May 1943 by Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Company, Stockton, California, as YN-71; launched on 14 September 1943; redesignated as AN-52 on 20 January 1944; and commissioned on 16 March 1944, Lt. Comdr. Robert W. Nordstrom, USNR, in command. Snowbell began her shakedown cruise from the San Diego, California, area on 16 April 1944. She was then ordered to San Pedro, California, to maintain the extensive harbor net installation there and also act as a training ship for the Small Craft Training Center.


On 24 December 1944, the ship entered the yard of Craig Shipbuilding, Long Beach, California, for alteration and refitting. Her main mast was removed and two 20 millimeter guns were added. On 27 January 1945, loaded with nets and moorings, Snowbell sailed for Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii.


Snowbell arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 February. A week later, she sailed for Ulithi, via Eniwetok and Johnston Island. The net tender remained there from 6 to 11 March; sailed for San Pedro, Leyte Gulf; and departed there on the 19th for operations in preparation or the amphibious assault on Okinawa Gunto. The net layer entered the anchorage at Kerama Retto on 28 March and began laying a curtain of nets to protect American shipping from possible submarine attack.


Snowbell tended nets at Kerama Retto until 15 May and then moved to Buckner Bay. On the 25th, she shot down her first enemy plane, a single-engine fighter plane, which crashed a few hundred yards from the ship. She continued operating in waters around Okinawa after the war had ended until early October. On 9 October, a typhoon with winds of approximately 150 miles per hour struck the area and Snowbell. Her stern anchor let go, and she collided with Chinquapin (AN-17) on the starboard side. At 1630, she went aground. On the reef only a few minutes, the ship's timbers began to break up. The ship was pounded by high winds and heavy seas. The next morning, the commanding officer ordered all hands to leave the ship lest she capsize.


On 30 October, an Inspection and Survey Board found the ship was unsalvageable. All equipment and stores were removed, and she was decommissioned on 5 December. Snowbell was struck from the Navy list on 19 December 1945, and her hulk was blown up on 14 January 1946.

40088985,Canadian Senate expenses scandal,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Senate_expenses_scandal,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Senate_expenses_scandal&action=info,"The Canadian Senate expenses scandal was a political scandal concerning the expense claims of certain Canadian senators which began in late 2012. Senators Patrick Brazeau, Mike Duffy, Mac Harb, and Pamela Wallin claimed travel and living allowance expenses from the Senate for which they were not eligible. Deloitte LLP was retained to provide the Senate with an independent examination of the expense claims. Duffy, Harb, and Wallin repaid ineligible amounts. Harb retired a few months into the scandal, and in November 2013, Brazeau, Duffy, and Wallin were suspended from the Senate without pay. Brazeau, Duffy, and Harb were criminally charged. On April 21, 2016 Duffy was acquitted on all charges. Charges against Harb were withdrawn and no charges were to be laid against Wallin. The scandal attracted much public attention, with as many as 73% of Canadians following it closely.


As a result, the Auditor General of Canada examined expense claims made by all the other 116 senators and former senators over a two-year period. In a June 2015 report, the Auditor General identified thirty senators whose claims were inappropriate, and of these, recommended that nine cases be referred for police investigation. Fourteen of these senators opted for binding arbitration by former Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ian Binnie, and his report was issued on March 21, 2016.


The investigation of senator expenses began in November 2012 with the living expense claims of Patrick Brazeau and the travel expense claims of Pamela Wallin. By December 6, 2012, the Senate investigation was expanded to include the living expenses of Mac Harb On January 3, 2013, the Senate formally retained Deloitte LLP to review the claims of Brazeau, Harb and Wallin. In February 2013, the Deloitte retainer was expanded to include Mike Duffy's living expense claims.


In March 2013, and before the Deloitte audit was complete, Duffy repaid $90,172 for the living expenses he had claimed.:â5â  It was later learned in May 2013 through the media that the source of this money was a personal cheque provided by Nigel Wright, who was then Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office.


On May 9, 2013, the Senate released reports about the expenses of Brazeau, Duffy and Harb, along with Deloitte's reports. It acknowledged Deloitte's finding that the criteria for determining a senator's primary residence was lacking. However, the intent and purpose of Senate policies for reimbursement of living expenses were ""amply clear"" and so Brazeau and Harb were ordered to repay living expenses. On August 13, 2013, the Senate released Deloitte's report on the expenses of Wallin and she was ordered to repay travel expenses. As of July 25, 2013, Harb still maintained his innocence;


It emerged that the Conservative-dominated Senate committee had drafted the May 9 report on Duffy's living expenses to reflect less poorly on Duffy, who was at that time a member of the Conservative caucus. After two weeks of controversy, and amid concerns that Duffy was claiming travel expenses from both the Senate and the Conservative Party, the Senate reopened Duffy's audit. On May 29, 2013 the Senate issued a report amending the May 9 one, and recommending that Duffy's case be referred to ""the proper authorities.""


In the months following, many of Canada's political parties reiterated their positions that the Senate should be reformed or abolished. On February 1, 2013, the Harper government sought clarification from the Supreme Court of Canada on the federal government's legislative power to reform or abolish the Senate. On April 25, 2014 the court ruled that this could not be done through federal legislation, but rather required constitutional amendment. To reform the Senate, the consent of at least seven provinces, which collectively have half of Canada's population, is required. Abolishment requires the consent of all ten provinces. The provinces' premiers, however, do not consider either a high priority.  The Quebec Court of Appeal has re-iterated the role of the provinces in any decision.


A June 2013 poll revealed that in the wake of the controversy, 49% of Canadians wanted to reform the Senate, 41% wanted to see it abolished, 6% wanted to keep it as it was, and 4% were unsure.


On May 12, 2013, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced they were reviewing the expense claims. The RCMP had started their investigation in March 2013 when media reports were published regarding Deloitte's external review of the expenses of Brazeau, Duffy and Harb.


On August 14, 2013, it was announced that the Auditor General of Canada would be reviewing the expense claims of all senators.


In June 2015, the report was released by Auditor General Michael Ferguson. The Auditor General recommended that the cases of nine senators, including incumbent senators Pierre-Hughes Boisvenue and Colin Kenny, be referred for RCMP investigation, while 21 other senators were flagged for filling inappropriate expense claims including Senate Speaker Leo Housakos, Senate Government Leader Claude Carignan and Opposition Leader James Cowan. The Report indicated that nearly $1 million worth of inappropriate expenses were filed by the 30 senators.


The senators identified in the Auditor General's report had the option to submit to binding arbitration by former Supreme Court of Canada Justice Binnie. Fourteen of the 30 senators opted for arbitration, and the arbitrator's report was issued on March 21, 2016. Of the total amount referred to arbitration, Binnie ruled that about 55% was owing to the Senate. In his report, he said that ""I impute no bad motives to any of the senators.""


The Senate's investigation into the accuracy of Brazeau's declaration that his primary residence was in Maniwaki, Quebec began as a result of media reports.


On November 20, 2012, a CTV reporter interviewed residents of Maniwaki, who said that Brazeau did not live there. The next day, the Senate Government Leader announced that a subcommittee would investigate whether Brazeau was in compliance with Senate rules. The review period was April 2011 when Brazeau began to claim living expenses to September 30, 2012, the last date for which full records were available.


The subcommittee's investigation ""raised a number of questions"", and so on December 11, 2012, it met with Brazeau and his lawyer. After this meeting, Deloitte was retained for external review.


Deloitte was not able to assess the status of Brazeau's declaration that his primary residence was in Maniwaki because the Senate regulations and guidelines did not contain a definition of primary residence. Deloitte was, however, able to confirm Brazeau's location for almost the entire review period. He was in Maniwaki about 10%, and in Ottawa about 81% of the time. He met all four ""indicators"" of primary residency (driver's licence, provincial health card, provincial tax return and voting location).:â2,â13â20â


Based on the finding that only 10% of Brazeau's time was in Maniwaki, the Senate ruled that his ""level of presence"" did not support his primary residence declaration. Brazeau was ordered to repay a total of $48,745.


On July 3, 2013, the Senate announced it would reduce Brazeau's salary by 20% to obtain repayment. It would have taken about 21 months to recoup all that was owing; however, this was interrupted by the suspension without pay in November 2013. With the parliamentary session ending when the federal election was called, it is expected that Brazeau will begin receiving his salary again, so further amounts may be recovered through the 20% reduction.


Brazeau was expelled from the Conservative caucus on February 7, 2013 over sexual assault allegations.


On February 4, 2014 the RCMP announced that Brazeau was charged in relation to his living expenses with one count of fraud under s. 380 of the Criminal Code and one of breach of trust by a public officer under s. 122. The trial will be scheduled for 2017.


On July 13, 2016, Crown Prosecutors withdrew the criminal charges against Brazeau, citing ""no reasonable prospect of conviction"".


Due to media reports regarding Harb's living expenses, the Senate began its investigation on December 6, 2012. The period of review was April 2011 to September 30, 2012 in keeping with the concurrent review of Brazeau's expenses which had been underway since November 22, 2012. The Senate chose not to conduct an internal review of Harb's expenses due to ""experience in conducting one claims review internally"", and so Deloitte was retained on January 3, 2013.


Harb's declarations of primary residence were Cobden and later Westmeath, Ontario. Deloitte was not able to assess the status of these declarations because the Senate regulations and guidelines did not contain criteria for determining primary residence. Deloitte was able to confirm that Harb spent about 62% of his time in Ottawa and about 21% at the primary residence location. He did not meet three of the four ""indicators"" of primary residence (driver's licence, provincial health card and provincial tax return) and did not provide sufficient information as to voting location.:â2,â13â


Based on the finding that only 21% of Harb's time was spent at Westmeath, his ""level of presence"" did not support his primary residence declaration, and the Senate ordered that he repay expenses from April 2011 to date of $51,482, and that an internal investigation take place for the period prior to April 2011. Harb repaid this amount under protest and commenced action for judicial review of the Senate order. On August 26, 2013, he announced that he had repaid a further amount of $180,166 and was dropping the judicial review application. The total repaid inclusive of interest was $231,649 for living expenses dating back to 2005.


Along with the announcement of repayment back to 2005, Harb announced his retirement from the Senate.  Because he had been an MP for Ottawa for 15 years prior to his Senate appointment, he was eligible for a fully indexed parliamentary pension of $122,989 per year.


On February 4, 2014, the RCMP announced that Harb was charged in relation to his living expenses with one count of fraud under s. 380 of the Criminal Code and one count of breach of trust by a public officer under s. 122.


Harb was scheduled go to court on August 10, 2015 His trial was postponed into 2016 because the Duffy trial was taking longer than expected. A month after Duffy was found not guilty, the charges against Harb were dropped because the Crown did not see a reasonable prospect of conviction.


Senate Administration was asked to provide a report of Duffy's travel patterns between PEI and Ottawa. Because this travel summary ""raised concerns"", on February 14, 2013, the Senate expanded Deloitte's review of expense claims to include Duffy's living expenses.


Deloitte was not able to assess the status of Duffy's declaration of primary residence in Cavendish, PEI because the Senate regulations and guidelines did not include criteria for determining a senator's primary residence. Deloitte was, however, able to confirm that Duffy spent about 54% of his time in Ottawa and about 30% in PEI. Of the four ""indicators"" of primary residence, he met one (driver's licence), did not meet two (provincial health card and provincial tax return), and did not provide sufficient information as to voting location.:â2,â12â14â


On March 26, 2013 Deloitte received a letter from Duffy's counsel stating that, as Duffy had repaid the living expenses under review, there was no further need for Duffy's participation in the Deloitte audit. The audit was completed without further documentation or meeting with Duffy.:â5â


On February 22, 2013, Duffy wrote to the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee saying that he ""may have been mistaken"" when filling out the Senate forms, that he wanted to ""repay the housing allowance"" and requesting the amount of this. On February 27, 2013, Duffy was advised that the amount owing inclusive of interest was $90,172.:â13â Repayment was made by cheque dated March 25, 2013 drawn on Duffy's account.:â9â On April 19, 2013, Duffy and the Senate separately announced that Duffy had repaid.:â16â


The source of the $90,172 was by personal cheque from Nigel Wright who was then Chief of Staff in the PMO. The payment was made by bank draft to Duffy's lawyer dated March 25, 2013.:â12â13â This did not become public until a media report of May 14, 2013.


On May 15, 2013, the Prime Minister's Office confirmed that Wright had provided Duffy with a personal cheque. The federal Ethics Commissioner announced that he would review the case.


The next day, Duffy resigned from the Conservative caucus;  he now sits as an independent senator.


On May 19, 2013, Wright announced that he had resigned from the PMO.:â9â
On May 22, 2013, Harper denied knowledge of the cheque. Harper's legal adviser also denied knowledge of the cheque.


On May 29, 2013 the Senate amended its May 9 report on Duffy's expenses, noting that Duffy's ""continued presence at his Ottawa residence over the years"" did not support his declaration of Cavendish, PEI as his primary residence. The Senate would refer the matter to the authorities.


According to unnamed sources, in February 2013 the Prime Minister's legal advisor, Benjamin Perrin, drafted a letter of understanding between Nigel Wright, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, and Duffy. The sources suggest that the letter stated Wright's intention to transfer $90,172 to cover Duffy's invalid expense claims. Perrin claims that the story is false.
On July 30, 2014, the Law Society of British Columbia announced that it closed its file related to Perrin's alleged role in the affair because the complaint was not valid. On October 25, 2014, the Law Society of Upper Canada also reported that after fully investigating, it had no concerns whatsoever with Perrin's conduct as a lawyer.


On June 5, 2013 Harper said in Parliament that: ""it was Mr. Wright who made the decision to take his personal funds and give those to Mr. Duffy so that Mr. Duffy could reimburse the taxpayers. Those were his decisions. They were not communicated to me or to members of my office.""


On October 21, 2013, Duffy's lawyer claimed that the Prime Minister's Office ""pushed"" Duffy into accepting the cheque, contrary to the Prime Minister's statements that no one in his office other than Wright knew of the deal. The next day, Duffy told the Senate that Harper personally told Duffy to repay the money, quoting him as saying, ""It's not about what you did. It's about the perception of what you did that's been created in the media. The rules are inexplicable to our base.""


On October 28, 2013, Harper stated in an interview that Wright had been ""dismissed,"" contradicting his previous statements, made in the spring, that Wright had made his own decision to resign.


Also on October 28, Duffy announced that the Conservative Party â via their chief lawyer, Arthur Hamilton â  paid all of his legal fees relating to the scandal, tabling a cheque stub and corresponding memo as proof. Duffy also tabled documents supporting the legality of his residency claims. Duffy also tabled an email sent to him from Nigel Wright's account at the Prime Minister's Office; the PMO had previously claimed that none existed in response to an Access to Information Act request.


The RCMP started its investigation in March 2013 after media reported that the Senate had retained Deloitte in relation to the expenses of Brazeau, Duffy and Harb.:â3â


On June 6, 2013, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) filed documents with the courts, revealing that three senior members of the Prime Minister's Office and another Conservative senator, Irving Gerstein, knew about the transfer of Wright's funds. According to the documents, the Conservative Party of Canada initially intended to pay $30,000 for Duffy to repay his expenses before they learned the full amount, and that Duffy was being investigated over three separate allegations of fraud.


On June 13, 2013 the RCMP confirmed they were beginning an Official investigation into Nigel Wright. On June 24, 2013 the lead investigator Cpl. Greg Horton put to the courts an affidavit reporting a June 19 meeting with Nigel Wright's lawyers. Later one of the lawyers told the RCMP that Wright remembers that he told his executive assistant David van Hemmen, Harper's legal adviser Benjamin Perrin, and PMO Director of Issues Management Chris Woodcock about his intention to give Duffy the money.


On April 15, 2014, the RCMP announced that they had found ""no ground for criminal charges"" against Wright and dropped their investigation into the matter, returning it to the federal Ethics Commissioner. An anonymous source stated, ""It was decided that it was best for him to act as a witness."" Harper would not be interviewed by the RCMP. Sources said the RCMP decided not to charge Wright following an interview with him as there was a lack of evidence he had criminal intent. The RCMP obtained information from Wright through his lawyer in June 2013, and interviewed Wright on July 18, 2013.:â11â20â


On July 17, 2014, the RCMP announced that it had laid 31 criminal charges against Duffy, including fraud under s. 380 of the Criminal Code, breach of trust by a public officer under s. 122, bribery of a judicial officer under s. 119(1)(a), and frauds on the government under s. 121(1)(c). Two charges related to the living expense claims, 18 to claiming expenses unrelated to Senate business, 8 to awarding of consulting contracts, and 3 to Wright's payment of $90,000.


Duffy's trial began on April 7, 2015 at the Ontario Court of Justice in Ottawa. He pleaded not guilty to all 31 charges. Charles Vaillancourt, who was the presiding judge in the case, found Duffy not guilty on all 31 charges. The Crown decided not to appeal, saying that Crown's right of appeal is limited to errors of law.


Wallin's travel expense claims came under investigation in November 2012 because she had an ""unusual travel pattern"". When travelling between her declared primary residence in Saskatchewan and Ottawa, Wallin often stopped over in Toronto, and was claiming the Toronto leg as part of her expenses. A senator may claim travel expenses only if parliamentary business is being conducted at the travel destination.


Preliminary findings indicated ""a pattern of claiming Senate expenses on personal or other business unrelated to the Senate, including boards she sits on."" Wallin earned approximately $1 million in stock options and fees while on corporate boards since her appointment as senator. A Postmedia News analysis indicated Wallin was ranked second highest in overall spending at $369,593 behind recently retired Conservative Senator Gerry St. Germain, who spent $378,292 during the same period.


Deloitte determined that travel claims totaling $390,182 were appropriate under Senate practice, $121,348 were not appropriate and should be reimbursed, and $20,978 were questionable and subject to interpretation by the Senate Steering Committee.:â2â


Although Wallin did not meet two of the four ""indicators"" of primary residence (provincial health card and tax return), and had not provided sufficient information as to voting location, Deloitte concluded that her primary residence, as declared, was in Saskatchewan. This was based on travel pattern, no privately owned property in Ottawa for a significant period of time, and time in Ottawa being almost exclusively for Senate business.:â4,â26â31â


Wallin reimbursed the Senate $38,369 following her own review, and an additional $114,538 inclusive of interest in September 2013.


Senator Wallin delivered a speech in the Senate, where she condemned the body for ignoring the rule of law:


In May 2013 Wallin resigned from the Senate Conservative caucus pending the results of the external audit of her expense.


The results of the Deloitte audit were referred to the RCMP for criminal investigation.


By March 2015, the RCMP had identified 150 ""suspicious"" claims, with 21 of these involving her role on boards of Bell Media and BMO Harris Private Banking, and as chancellor for the University of Guelph. In August 2015 the RCMP referred its file to Crown prosecutors for decision whether criminal charges would be laid. A month after Duffy was found not guilty, the RCMP announced that it was no longer pursuing charges against Wallin.


After 2 weeks of debate, on Tuesday November 5, 2013 the Senate voted to suspend Mike Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau without pay and most benefits. The Senators kept their health and dental benefits as well as their life insurance. The Senators were expected to be automatically and fully reinstated with the dissolution of Parliament prior to the 42nd Canadian general election, but due to pending charges against Duffy and Brazeau, certain Senate resources remain unavailable to them.
Following Duffy's acquittal on all charges, he returned to the Senate in full standing.


Each province or territory is allocated a set number of Senate seats, so that Canada's regions have a voice in the legislative process, even if their population is comparatively small.


Senators must own property in the region for which they are appointed, and they ""shall be resident"" in that region. There is no definition of ""resident"".


Senators are expected to remain members of the region which they represent and to continue public duties there, as well as attending to Senate business in Ottawa. Senators whose primary residence is more than 100 kilometers from Ottawa are entitled to claim living expenses (accommodation and per diems) while in Ottawa on Senate business, and travel costs to commute between Ottawa and their primary residence. The Ottawa location must be the senator's secondary residence for this entitlement to arise. Senators must make an annual declaration of primary and secondary residence, and keep it updated.:â5â6,â23â


Deloitte LLP was the audit firm hired by the Senate to investigate the expense claims of Brazeau, Duffy, Harb, and Wallin. The review periods of the Deloitte audits were: April 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012 for Brazeau, Duffy, and Harb, and for Wallin the review period was January 1, 2009 to September 30, 2012.


During the Deloitte review periods, the Senate regulations and guidelines did not contain criteria for determining which location was a senator's primary residence. Terms used without being clearly defined were: primary residence, secondary residence, NCR residence, and provincial residence.:â2â:â2â :â2â


The maximum living expenses claimable were $20,000, which increased to $22,000 under the Senate's June 5, 2012 Travel Policy.:â11â


The only definition of primary residence in the documents reviewed by Deloitte was in the Senator's Travel Policy that was effective June 5, 2012. That policy defined primary residence as ""the residence identified by the senator as his/her main residence and is situated in the province or territory represented by the senator."":â13â:â13â:â13â:â27â28â


On December 6, 2012, the Senate Steering Committee asked Senate Administration to assess whether the declarations of primary residence of all senators was sufficiently supported by documentation. Senators were asked to provide: 1. driver's license, 2. provincial health card, 3. provincial income tax return; and 4. signed statement of voting location. Deloitte referred to these as ""indicators"" of primary residence.:â13â:â13â:â13â:â28â


On February 28, 2013, the committee reported that it was satisfied with the documentation provided and no further senators were to be referred for external review.


The Senator's Travel Policy was reviewed to ""comply with primary residence declarations"" and a report was made on May 9, 2013. Among the recommendations was that the following be deleted from the Senate Rules: ""Senators act on their personal honour and Senators are presumed to have acted honourably in carrying out their administrative functions unless and until the Senate or the Internal Economy Committee determines otherwise."" The definitions of National Capital accommodation and provincial residence were changed, but no reference was made to changing the definition of primary residence.


Senators may claim travel expenses, under a 64-point travel system, when the purpose of the trip is for parliamentary business.:â13â


The Senator's Resource Guide that was in effect during the Deloitte review periods stipulated that travel expenses would be paid when senators were carrying out ""their parliamentary functions within their region, to and from Ottawa, and elsewhere in Canada ..."" The June 5, 2012 Travel Policy was to the same effect, and included an elaboration that funding under the 64-point system is intended for ""travel incurred in the carrying out of Senators' parliamentary functions or that is otherwise incurred for the service of the Senate."" Travel for personal concerns, private business interests, or related to election of an MP during a federal election were specifically excluded. An Appendix provided examples of travel purposes that would or would not be funded.:â8â13â


Deloitte and the Auditor General noted that the June 5, 2012 Travel Policy did not make substantive changes to the Senate's previous travel policies. Some senators agreed with this interpretation, while other senators were of the view that this policy ""changed the requirements that applied to them."":â3â


When claiming their travel expenses, senators indicated on their claim form that the purpose of the trip was for parliamentary or Senate business. They were required to retain details of the nature of the business for seven years.:â2â However, the Auditor General noted that in ""many cases"", senators did not keep these records.:â16â


In June 2012, after doing a performance audit of Senate Administration, the Auditor General reported that ""improvements were needed so that documentation would be sufficient to demonstrate that the transactions [authorized] were for parliamentary business."" In late 2012 and early 2013, ""questions arose"" as to the living expenses of Brazeau, Duffy, and Harb, and the travel expenses of Wallin. On June 6, 2013, the Senate asked the Auditor General to ""conduct a comprehensive audit of Senate expenses, including Senators' expenses."":â4â


The audit encompassed all expenses of 116 senators and former senators over a two-year period between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2013.:â2â In determining whether expenses were incurred for parliamentary business, the ""fundamental principle"" of the audit was that ""public funds should not be used to pay for personal or private activities."":â4â


The Auditor General reported that ""the oversight, accountability, and transparency of Senators' expenses was quite simply not adequate."" A ""transformational change"" was needed in all areas of senator expenses:  how these are ""claimed, managed, controlled, and reviewed."":â1â


Independent oversight of senators' expenses needs to be established. The Standing Senate Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration (the ""Internal Economy Committee"") has the statutory authority over all financial and administrative matters. This includes budget authorization, setting and clarifying policies for senator entitlement to claim expenses, and deciding in individual cases whether an expense claim is appropriate. Because this Senate committee is composed of individual senators, there is a conflict of interest which ""may give rise to a perceived lack of objectivity."" An oversight body whose membership is independent of the Senate should be established, along with mandating the Auditor General as the external auditor.:â9â12â


Senators should ""collectively determine a core set of principles that weigh the cost to taxpayers against the expenditures necessary to conduct parliamentary business."" This recommendation arose because the Auditor General ""found many occasions where Senators' choices could have been less costly, particularly in relation to travel, per diems, and telecommunications."":â12â15â


Senators need to maintain detailed records of the nature of the parliamentary business for which an expense is incurred, and submit these details to Senate Administration when making expense claims.:â15â18â


Establish greater transparency. Senators should disclose ""any close personal or business relationships, or outside interests"" relating to claims and expenditures. In some cases, this disclosure would be made to Senate Administration and in other cases, made public on the Senate website.:â18â20â


Ensure that the ""financial management practices"" of the Office of the Speaker of the Senate are consistent with those that govern all senator expenses.:â-21â22â


Thirty senators or former senators were found to have made inappropriate or ineligible expense claims. Of the 30, the Auditor General recommended that nine cases (detailed in Appendix A) be referred for police investigation. The other 21 cases (detailed in Appendix B) were recommended for review by the Senate's Internal Economy Committee to make a determination whether the expenses were for parliamentary business.:â23â25â


The Senate referred all 30 cases to the RCMP. As at March 16, 2016, the RCMP found no evidence to warrant criminal charges against 24 of the 30 senators, including Pierre-Hughes Boisvenu, Sharon Carstairs, William Rompkey and Rod Zimmer. The RCMP is still investigating six senators, including Marie-P. Charette-Poulin, Colin Kenny, Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, Donald Oliver and Gerry St. Germain.


A dispute resolution process through binding arbitration was established for senators who disagreed with the Auditor General's findings. Ian Binnie, retired Supreme Court of Canada Justice, led the arbitration.


In each of the nine cases recommended for police investigation, the Auditor General found one or both of the following::â37â


""The Senator or former Senator had made ineligible claims for living expenses incurred while in the National Capital Region and other travel expenses when we determined that the Senator or former Senator had not established a substantive presence at his or her declared primary residence....


""There was such a pervasive lack of evidence, or significant contradictory evidence, that we were prevented from reaching an audit opinion about whether the expenses had been incurred for parliamentary business.""


The nine senators are:


The repayment status of the nine senators and the results of arbitration of the two who opted for arbitration as at May 31, 2016 are:


The Auditor General recommended that the Senate's Internal Economy Committee review 21 cases and make a determination as to eligibility to claim the expenses because::â65â


""we could not accept the Senators' expenses as having been incurred for parliamentary business, because of the nature or significance of the transactions, or because there was insufficient information to support them, or


""we determined the expenses were not in accordance with the applicable Senate rules, policies, or guidelines.""


The repayment status of the 21 senators and results of arbitration of the 12 senators who opted for arbitration, as at May 31, 2016 are:


In the News Release accompanying the March 21, 2016 release of former Justice Binnie's arbitration report, the Senate said that the report would assist in its efforts to ""bring clarity"" to Senate expense claim rules. 
As part of its modernization, the Senate has ""made several significant changes including tightening expense provisions for travel, hospitality and procurement; requiring proof of residency; implementing a new Ethics and Conflict of Interest Code that ranks among the toughest in the Commonwealth; and the establishment of an independent Office of the Senate Ethics Officer."" The Senate will also introduce ""a more detailed model of proactive disclosure and more independent oversight measures.""",5,28 July 2013, 4 August 2021,299,0,0

Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council re-emphasised the importance of the early implementation of the disarmament of all Somali parties, factions and movements, as well as neutralizing radio broadcasting systems that contributed to attacks towards United Nations forces. It also demanded that all parties in Somalia comply with the commitments they had undertaken in the agreements they concluded at the informal Preparatory Meeting on Somali Political Reconciliation in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, reaffirming that the UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is authorised to take action against those responsible for the armed attacks against UNOSOM II to establish its authority throughout Somalia.


The Council concluded by encouraging the deployment of all UNOSOM II contingents to meet the full requirements of 28,000 men; urging Member States to contribute equipment to the Operation; and for the Secretary-General to report back on the situation within seven days of the adoption of the current resolution.

It is directed by debutante Romilla Mukherjee and stars Ava Mukherjee with Zain Khan, Amit Verma and Shweta Gulati.


It's a regular day at Gulmohar Complex. Spunky, independent, 72-year-old Naani is on her way back home from her daily morning walk. Suddenly her eye catches the face of a little girl peeping nervously from a 3rd floor window. The flat belongs to a newly arrived childless couple called Yadavs.


The girl hides away quickly. Naani's intrigue about the little girl leads her to a possible murder. Naani finds herself in the middle of a mystery where some people will come to her aid, some will be indifferent and some will prove to be dangerous. When the CID dismisses Naani's story due to lack of hard evidence, she transforms into a detective.


She uses her home-spun common-sense and logic and she carries out her investigation in classic ""whodunit"" style. Of course, Naani's rather eccentric methods of investigation lead to many quirky and humorous incidents. Her unusual team of deputies consists of her two inquisitive little grandchildren Anjali and Nakul, her divorced daughter Priya Sinha and a couple of teenagers Rohan and Neeti.


The search for one lost little girl leads Naani & Co. to a racket where the stakes are high, the criminals are ruthless, and their leader is powerful. Once Naani gets too close to their trail, she endangers herself. She finds herself sharing the same plight as the little girl she had seen in the window. Naani's team of amateur detectives get together and finally win the day with a little help from the CID.At the heart of this story is the terrified, kidnapped little girl. Her plight acts as a reminder to the audience that Naani's mission  was  a race against time. And yet, this adventure has a positive effect on all the characters that get involved. Bridges are built, relationships blossom, lessons are learnt.


The two squabbling teenagers fall in love, there is a whiff of a romance between Naani's divorced daughter and the dashing CID Inspector. Old Mr. Pal finds a renewed energy and interest in life. And of course, a lost 4-year-old little girl Neelima Daamle is finally re-united with her mother. The Yadavs are sent to jail for the crime of human trafficking.",0,26 July 2009, 11 May 2021,67,0,0

2173837,Siege of Medina Fort,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Medina_Fort,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Medina_Fort&action=info,"The Siege of Fort Medina took place in 1857 at MÃ©dine, on the left bank of the Senegal River in present-day Mali. The Toucouleur forces of Omar Saidou Tall unsuccessfully besieged native and French colonial troops commanded by Paul Holle. After 97 days of siege, a relief force under French Governor Louis Faidherbe lifted the siege and forced the Toucouleur army to retreat.


Although France had been present on the coast of what is now Senegal since the 17th century with Saint-Louis and GorÃ©e, it had never attempted to expand outside of these two settlements.  In 1854 however, Colonel Louis Faidherbe was appointed Governor of Senegal and soon began an expansion of French interests into Waalo and up the Senegal River, alongside which the French began establishing a series of forts. The army moved troops, cannon and other supplies by steamship where possible and overland where not.


In 1848, Omar Tall launched his jihad against neighboring MalinkÃ© regions.  By 1855, his rapid expansion had led to several skirmishes with the French army.  With the authorization of his ally, Khasso Queen Hawa Demba Diallo, Governor Faidherbe ordered a fort built at the Khasso village of Medina, not far from Kayes.


In late April 1857, the entire Toucouleur army, roughly 20,000 warriors under Oumar Tall, marched on the village of MÃ©dine.


Fort MÃ©dine's garrison consisted in the fort's commander Paul Holle, seven white French soldiers, 22 Senegalese Tirailleurs and 34 sailors from Saint-Louis. The population of the village, numbering roughly 6,000 immediately sought shelter in the fort as the Toucouleur forces appeared.


On April 20, the Toucouleur launched their first assault on the fort. Using ladders made from palm tree branches, Toucouleur warriors attempted to climb the wall, under devastating rifle and cannon fire from the defenders. French firepower proved too strong however, and the Toucouleur eventually withdrew from the walls, leaving 300 dead behind. The French had lost 6 killed and 13 wounded in the attack.


In the night of 11 May, some 200 Toucouleur warriors landed on a small island on the river about 100 meters from the fort, where large rocks gave them a well covered position to fire on the fort while being protected from French fire. On the morning, Holle sent sergeant Desplats with 8 tirailleurs and 3 sailors in a summarily fortified boat to attack the Toucouleur party from behind. The surprised Toucouleur warriors left their cover in panic and half of them were killed by the fort's defenders' heavy fire, while many others drowned while hastily fleeing from the island.


In the night of 4-5 June, the Toucouleur army attempted a second assault on the fort, but it was less resolute than the first one and was easily repulsed by the French. However, French ammunition and food reserves were running low.


Due to the low tide of the river, Holle was rather pessimistic about the arrival of a relief force. Along with sergeant Desplats, he took some dispositions to blow up the fort should the enemy manage to take over. To avoid affecting the morale of the defenders, both men kept it a secret from the rest of the troops.


On 2 July, Governor Faidherbe and the gunboat Basilic had departed from Saint-Louis to rescue Fort-MÃ©dine, but the low level of the river prevented them from reaching their goal. In the night of July 17 however, the flow of the river finally increased after massive rains, and the Basilic could finally continue its way upstream.


On 18 July, Faidherbe arrived at MÃ©dine on the Basilic, alongside 400 tirailleurs and 100 white troops. After landing, Faidherbe's men launched a bayonet charge on a small hill held by some Toucouleur warriors, and from there unleashed a heavy rifle and artillery fire on the main Toucouleur force below. As the Toucouleurs fled alongside the river toward the fort, men who had remained on the Basilic sprayed them with an intense gunfire. The Toucouleur army disbanded and left the vicinity of MÃ©dine in disorganized retreat. As soon as the enemy had disappeared from sight, the starved civilians hidden in the fort came out to eat grass and roots nearby. Once the fighting was over, the Basilic discharged its food supply to the fort.


For his stubborn defense of Fort-MÃ©dine, Paul Holle was awarded the Legion of Honour.


Following the relief of Fort MÃ©dine, Faidherbe signed a treaty with the Omar Tall gaining concessions for the French down to the Niger River.


Realizing the difficulties of attacking the well-equipped French, Omar Tall turned his attention to the neighboring Bambara Empire, conquering most of its territory including its capital of SÃ©gou in 1861.  However, the French continued to expand their West African presence, conquering SÃ©gou and the Toucouleur Empire less than thirty years after Omar Taal's death.


The Fort of MÃ©dine is open to the public.  The Fort is located about 12Â km east of Kayes on the ""road to Bamako.""  There is also an old railroad station and European-style cemetery with graves from the mid-19th century.

He also was a politician, serving in the Michigan House of Representatives for the 1841 session.


Early in his career, Drew was an agent under Michael Dousman, trading with the local Ojibwe and Odaawaa. Later, together with Edward Biddle, Drew was part owner of Biddle & Drew. 


In the 1836 Treaty of Washington, with the Ottawa, etc. (7Â Stat.Â 491), Drew was granted a tract of one section and three quarters, to his Indian family, at Cheboygan rapids, at the rate of four dollars.

LÃ¡szlÃ³ Simon was born in Miskolc. He studied under ZoltÃ¡n BenkÃ¶ in Budapest, and under Hans Leygraf in Stockholm and Hannover. He also received artistic and pianistic incitements from Claudio Arrau in New York. He would later be praised for his excellent performance in international piano competitions Casagrande (1971, 1st place, jointly shared), Geneva and Busoni and received the King's Swedish Music Award. His recording of the twelfth Transcendental Ãtudes by Franz Liszt was later part of the evidence in the plagiarism scandal involving recordings by the English pianist Joyce Hatto (1928-2006), and became more famous as a result of the investigation.


LÃ¡szlÃ³ Simon was a respected piano teacher throughout the world. After working in Darmstadt, Hannover and Karlsruhe, he became a professor at the Berlin University of the Arts in 1981.  In this position, he mentored the conductress Shi-yeon Sung as well as the pianists Gergely Boganyi, Li-Chun Su and Ji-yeoun You. He died in Berlin, aged 63.


D.A.W.M.: Remarkable Liszt. In: The Daily Telegraph (1975)


Laszlo Simon ... is a distinguished artist, having not only a stupendous technique with an unusually large and sonorous tone, but also ripe experience and deep familiarity with the music of Schubert, Beethoven, and Liszt. Only a completely equipped player could have given such a remarkable performance of the Liszt Sonata, soaring into its heights and bringing out every modulation in its depth and without the slightest loss of tonal purity. Claritiy and directness of manner also served Mr Simon well in Beethoven's Sonata in D minor Op. 31 No. 2. The melodic line of the Adagio was beautifully shaped and having such a command of legato, he could probably have taken the whole movement a shade more slowly without losing impetus.

D.A.W.M.: LÃ¡szlÃ³ Simon. In: The Daily Telegraph (Feb. 1977)


The Hungarian pianist LÃ¡szlÃ³ Simon chose music by his great compatriots Liszt and BartÃ³k, for his return visit to London last night. 


His strong and skilful fingers produced patterns of sound in BartÃ³k's Suite, the scherzo and the allegro third movement beinig played with a stronger tone than is usual. Mr Simon's prowess was in keeping with the brilliant, extrovert qualities of the BartÃ³k Sonata, the big stretches in the last movement having no terrors for him, yet sometimes his playing was a little too rigid rhythmically to sustain the stark drama of the quick movements.



Mr Simon's performance of Liszt's FunÃ©railles and Ricordanza were both exciting and lyrical, and the Mephisto Waltz revealed the technical command and the craftsmanlike apitude of this young and vital player.

Dominic Gill: Laszlo Simon. In: London Financial Times (1977)


The Hungarian pianist LÃ¡szlÃ³ Simon divided his recital in the Purcell Room last Friday between BartÃ³k and Liszt. It was no fault of his that the extraordinary Liszt playing of Jorge Bolet the previous evening was still ringing so powerfully in our ears; but certain comparisons were unavoidable. They were also unfortunate, for Mr. Simon is an exceptionally talented young artist: he has a strong technique, and a searching, individual way with the familiar romantic repertory that showed a refreshing contempt for easy clichÃ©: his manner is quick and confident, and he is not afraid, when necessary to push himself to his limits.",1,3 May 2016, 23 August 2021,33,0,0

35838712,Little Free Library,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Free_Library,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Little_Free_Library&action=info,"Little Free Library is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes neighborhood book exchanges, usually in the form of a public bookcase. More than 90,000 public book exchanges are registered with the organization and branded as Little Free Libraries. Through Little Free Libraries, present in 91 countries, millions of books are exchanged each year, with the aim of increasing access to books for readers of all ages and backgrounds. The Little Free Library nonprofit organization is based in Hudson, Wisconsin, United States.


The first Little Free Library was built in 2009 by the late Todd Bol in Hudson, Wisconsin. Bol mounted a wooden container, designed to look like a one-room schoolhouse, on a post on his lawn and filled it with books as a tribute to his late mother, a book lover and school teacher who had recently died. Bol shared his idea with his partner, Rick Brooks, and together they built and installed more of the bookhouses in different areas of the Midwestern United States. After a while, the idea started to spread.


Little Free Library officially incorporated as a nonprofit organization on May 16, 2012, and the Internal Revenue Service recognized Little Free Library as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization later that year.


Bol's original goal was the creation of 2,510 Little Libraries. This would surpass the number of libraries founded by Andrew Carnegie, in a program where library buildings were constructed and endowed in cities across the United States. That goal was met in 2012.


The movement also was adopted internationally. By November 2016, there were 50,000 registered Little Free Libraries in 85 countries worldwide. Margret Aldrich wrote The Little Free Library Book to chronicle the movement.


As of August 2019 the number of Little Free Libraries has increased to more than 90,000 such bookhouses in 91 countries around the world.


Bol died from pancreatic cancer in October 2018. M. Greig Metzger II joined the organization as executive director in July 2019.


The Little Free Library nonprofit has been honored by the National Book Foundation, the Library of Congress, Library Journal, and others for its work promoting literacy and a love of reading.


The Little Free Library organization has used funds raised to donate book exchanges through their Impact Library Program and create a reading program called the Action Book Club. It combines reading with community service.


Like other public book exchanges, a passerby can take a book to read or leave one for someone else to find. The organization relies on volunteer ""stewards"" to construct, install, and maintain book exchange boxes. For a book exchange box to be registered and legally use the Little Free Library brand name, stewards must purchase a finished book exchange, a kit or, for a DIY project, a charter sign, which contains the ""Little Free Library"" text and official charter number.


Registered Little Free Libraries can appear on the Little Free Library World Map, which lists locations with GPS coordinates and other information. Little Free Libraries are located around the world; the majority are located in the United States.


Little Free Libraries of all shapes and sizes exist, from small, brightly painted wooden houses to a larger library based on Doctor Who's TARDIS.


Little Free Libraries are typically welcomed by communities; if zoning problems arise, however, local governments often work with residents to find solutions. In late 2012, the village of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, denied permission to potential Little Free Library projects and required that an existing Little Free Library be removed because of a village ordinance that prohibited structures in front yards. Village trustees also worried about inappropriate material being placed in the boxes. However, in August 2013, the village approved a new ordinance that specifically allowed Little Free Library boxes to be put up on private property.


On June 17, 2015 Portland, Oregon Mayor Charlie Hales declared it ""Little Community Kiosk day"" in response to community confusion over right-of-way rules. On that day, he and the Portland City Council amended city code to allow for community kiosks such as Little Free Libraries in neighborhoods.


In June 2014, city officials in Leawood, Kansas shut down a Little Free Library under a city ordinance prohibiting detached structures. The family of the nine-year-old boy who built the structure created a Facebook page to support the amendment of Leawood's city code. Another resident of the city who erected a Little Free Library was threatened with a $25 fine. In July, the city council unanimously approved a temporary moratorium to permit Little Free Libraries on private property.


On January 29, 2015, the Metropolitan Planning Commission in Shreveport, Louisiana shut down a Little Free Library. Zoning administrator Alan Clarke said that city ordinances permitted libraries only in commercial zones and that the one that was shut down had âbothered someone.â The following month, the city council temporarily legalized book exchange boxes until the zoning ordinances could be amended to permanently allow them.


In North America, Little Free Libraries, and, implicitly, other public bookcases, have been criticized for being placed mostly in neighborhoods of wealthier, well-educated people, where there are already high-quality traditional public libraries nearby. The commentator encourages groups to assist neighborhoods where such facilities are lacking.


As of June 2019, the United States had more than 600 Little Free Pantries, and more can be found in Canada, The Netherlands and Australia. The Little Pantries function similarly to the libraries, as places where anyone can bring food and anyone can take food. Personal hygiene items such as soap and toothbrushes are also distributed. The first Little Free Pantry opened May 12, 2016 in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Another 100 were installed within months, including pantries in New Zealand. Items not allowed, according to informal rules, include razors, alcohol, and breakable glass containers.


Blessing Boxes, which are similar to the Little Free Pantries, are often sponsored by churches. They provide a place for sharing food and other useful goods, such as clothing. People are encouraged to ""pay it forward"" and donate whatever they can, such as a can of beans. ""The idea is that anyone walking by who may be struggling can use the goods to make ends meet and get through the day.""",9,16 May 2012, 17 August 2021,230,0,0

64134325,Kantemir Tsalikov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantemir_Tsalikov,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kantemir_Tsalikov&action=info,"Kantemir Aleksandrovich Tsalikov (Russian: ÐÐ°Ð½ÑÐµÐ¼Ð¸Ñ ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ Ð¦Ð°Ð»Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²; 10 April 1908 â 21 July 1944) was an Ossetian Red Army major general who held division and corps command during World War II. 


Tsalikov served as a junior officer in the early 1930s and held staff positions after graduating from the Frunze Military Academy. A division chief of staff when Operation Barbarossa began, he became a regimental commander in the first weeks of the war and was decorated for his performance. As a result, Tsalikov was given command of the 377th Rifle Division, which he led in operations to relieve the Siege of Leningrad. In late 1942 he was appointed commander of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division, leading it in the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad. Tsalikov was decorated for his leadership of the division in the latter, the Donbas Strategic Offensive, and the Crimean Offensive. He rose to command the 13th Guards Rifle Corps after the end of the Crimean Offensive, but was killed by a mine during the Å iauliai Offensive in mid-1944. 


An Ossetian, Tsalikov was born on 10 April 1908 in the village of Nogkau, Terek Oblast. He joined the Red Army in October 1929 and became a cadet at the Transcaucasian Infantry School. Following his graduation in March 1932, Tsalikov was posted to the 240th Rifle Regiment of the 80th Rifle Division in the Ukrainian Military District, where he served as a rifle and training platoon commander and as commander and political officer of a company. Awarded the Order of the Red Star in 1934 for successes in combat training, he began advanced studies at the Frunze Military Academy in May 1935 and after his graduation in August 1938 was appointed senior assistant section chief of the 1st staff department of the Far Eastern Front. This post proved brief and a month later Tsalikov became chief of staff of the 1st Separate Rifle Brigade of the 1st Red Banner Army, before being transferred west in October 1939 to serve as chief of staff of the 176th Rifle Division, which became part of the 35th Rifle Corps of the Odessa Military District.


After Operation Barbarossa began, Tsalikov and his unit fought in Bessarabia with the 9th Army of the Southern Front. Defending positions on the east bank of the Prut, the division faced the German and Romanian advance southwest of Kishinev. During the fighting, Tsalikov, by now a major, assumed command of the 591st Rifle Regiment of the 176th after its commander was wounded. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his ""bravery and courage"" in the fighting near Skulyany and ""skillful organization"" of the crossing of the Dniester by the 591st and 300th Artillery Regiments of the division.


In September, Tsalikov was sent to the Ural Military District to command the 377th Rifle Division, forming in the camps at Chebarkul. The division was railed to the front during November and the first half of December to join the 39th Army in reserve near Tikhvin. The 377th was soon transferred to the 4th Army on the Volkhov Front and from 21 December fought in the Tikhvin Offensive, fighting in the area of Moshki, Nikitino, Moiseyevo, and Zarechye. In January it bypassed German forces to reach the east bank of the Volkhov south of Kirishi, where it crossed the river and entrenched on the opposite bank. Shifted to the 59th Army, the 377th fought in the Lyuban Offensive beginning on 28 January and four days later cut roads in the German rear. Reaching the line of Maloye Opochivalovo by 6 February, it was ordered to strike southwest to exploit the successful advance of the 378th Rifle Division. The offensive stalled in late February, by which time the division had advanced as far as the line of Hill 28.3 and Mikhalevo. For his ""skillful leadership"" of the division in these operations, Tsalikov was awarded a second Order of the Red Banner. For the next several months the division defended positions on the Polist.


Appointed commander of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division of the 2nd Shock Army in September 1942, Tsalikov was transferred with the division to the Stalingrad Front to join the 2nd Guards Army in mid-December following nearly two months in reserve near Sinyavino. The division repulsed the German attack in Operation Winter Storm and on 24 December went on the offensive. Breaking through stubborn Axis resistance, the 3rd Guards crossed the Manych on 19 January 1943 and reached the Don in the North Caucasus Offensive. In the subsequent Rostov Offensive, the division captured the northern part of Novocherkassk with an attack from the north and northeast and pursued the retreating Axis troops to the Mius, reached by 18 February. Withdrawn to the reserve to rebuild, the division returned to combat with the 2nd Guards Army in the Mius Offensive in mid-July. Tsalikov and his division were surrounded by a German counterattack on 30 July and did not break out until 1 August. After receiving reinforcements, the 3rd Guards fought in the Donbas Strategic Offensive from 18 August, then went on to participate in the Melitopol Offensive and the Crimean Offensive. His superior, 1st Guards Rifle Corps commander Lieutenant General Ivan Missan, evaluated him as ""personally daring and decisive"" and ""always on the frontline, inspiring subordinates with his courage.""


After the end of the Crimean Offensive, the 3rd Guards and its army were withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, and two days later Tsalikov was appointed commander of the 13th Guards Rifle Corps of the army, which the division was assigned to. He led the corps as part of the army in the Å iauliai Offensive from 8 July. He was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for his ""skillful command of rifle units and formations in different types of battle"" and ""proving himself to be a brave and courageous officer"". Tsalikov was killed at 08:30 on 21 July while circling the positions of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division when the Willys Jeep he was riding in struck a land mine near the village of Dudy, north of Kurkliai. His adjutant was also killed, while a submachine gunner accompanying him was wounded and the driver survived. Tsalikov was buried in Vitebsk.

5837556,Roman Catholic Diocese of Pinerolo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Pinerolo,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Pinerolo&action=info,"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pinerolo (Latin: Dioecesis Pineroliensis) is a Latin rite bishopric in the administrative province of Turin of Piedmont region, Northwestern Italy. It is a suffragan of the Metropolitan archbishopric of Turin.


The bishop's seat is in the Cattedrale di S. Donato in Pinerolo (which dates from the 9th century, and has an architecturally significant campanile). The city also has a former cathedral, now called the Chiesa San Verano ad Abbadia Alpina, It also has a minor basilica, the Basilica of San Maurizio, a Gothic church.


The ambitions of King Francis I of France with regard to the succession to the Duchy of Milan brought warfare into Savoy and Piedmont. The Emperor Charles V was likewise determined to retain the Duchy of Milan, and his strategy involved the occupation of Provence, making the mountain passes of Savoy of great military importance. This was especially the case at the end of the 17th century with the Duke of Savoy's fortress of Fenestrelle. French troops invaded Piedmont in 1536, and Pinerolo was conquered. The city and the diocese remained under French control until 1574. Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu launched a major campaign early in 1629, with the succession to the Duchy of Mantua as the pretext. They spent the Spring of 1629 in Susa, conducting a siege of Pinerolo, but, as it happened, the King fell deathly ill and had to withdraw. In 1630, at the end of the siege, Louis XIII promised the Abbot of Pinerolo that he would outlaw the Waldensian cult, and that he would use his influence with the Vatican to have Pinerolo made a bishopric. Pinerolo was officially handed over to France in 1631 with the treaty of Cherasco, which recognized Victor Amadeus I as the new Duke of Savoy, and was not freed until 1696.


In October 1685 King Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which cancelled the privileges which had been granted to the Protestants in the Edict of Nantes. On 12 October 1685 the King sent instructions to his ambassador in Turin, the Marquis d'Arcy, to issue the appropriate orders to the Seigneur d'Harleville, the royal agent in Pinerolo, to engage in efforts to convert the inhabitants of the nine valleys in which the Waldensians were permitted to live. The ambassador was also to encourage the Duke of Savoy, the protector of the Waldensians, to the same purpose. Pinerolo thus became the center of efforts at conversion.


Victor Amadeus II,  Duke of Savoy, Marquis of Saluzzo, Duke of Montferrat, Prince of Piedmont, Count of Aosta, Moriana and Nice, was recognized as King of Sardinia in 1720.


In 1743, Carlo Emanuele III established in Pinerolo the Ospizio dei Catecumeni, an institute for those who were converting to the Catholic faith. By decree of the French Republic of 29 January 1799, the institution was suppressed and converted into a charity hospital. It was reestablished after the overthrow of the French, though as the 19th century progressed, increasingly liberal attitudes directed the institution more and more in the direction of charity and less in that of catechetization.


The diocese of Pinerolo was established by Pope Benedict XIV on 23 December 1748, by the bull In sacrosancta, at the request of King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, on Piemontese territories split off from its Metropolitan, the Archdiocese of Torino.


This included territory from the suppressed Abbacy nullius of Santa Maria ad Abbadia Alpina. It was founded in 1064 by Adelaide, Princess of Susa, in Abbadia Alpina, less than two miles west of Pinerolo, which was part of the Marca di Torino (March of Turin). The lands belonging to the abbey were governed by the abbots of Pinerolo, even after the city had established itself as a commune (1200). From 1235, however, Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy exercised over the town a kind of protectorate, which in 1243 became absolute, and was exercised thereafter by the house of Savoy.


In creating the diocese, Pope Benedict XIV noted that the King of Sardinia had ceded to the new diocese his rights over the monastery of Oulx, and had given the palace of the Governor in Pinerolo to be used as the episcopal residence and seminary. The new bishop, Giovanni Battista D'OrliÃ©, however, judged that the palace was not appropriate for a seminary; but luckily in 1753 the new diocese received the bequest of his palazzo in Pinerolo from Count Luigi Piccone, the former Governor of Pinerolo and of the city and province of Asti. The bishop was able to preside over the solemn opening of the new seminary on 23 May 1753.


The Chapter of the Collegiate Churches of S. Donato and of S. Maurizio was founded perhaps as early as 1024, and it was certainly functioning as a single body by 1278.  They were certainly secular canons by the 14th century, though some have argued that they were originally regular canons. There were four canons and a provost. In a document of 1475 it is made clear that they did not live in common, but had separate residences (domus canonicales). By 1626 the number of canons was seven, and by 1648 the number had risen to twelve. At the time of the creation of the diocese in 1748, there were eighteen canons.


At the time the diocese was erected there were already working in its territory, in addition to the diocesan clergy of Turin, eight Dominican Order priests, twelve Franciscan priests, five Augustinian priests, six Jesuit priests, and eighteen Capuchin priests. There were eighteen professed nuns of the Visitation, thirty-six Clarisses, and twenty-five Augustinian nuns. The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) was suppressed by Pope Clement XIV on 21 July 1773.


In 1796 Piedmont was seized by the armies of the French Directory, the King driven into exile in Sardinia, and a Republic of Piedmont was declared. By a decree of 12 April 1801, the First Consul of the French Republic, N. Bonaparte, declared the Republic of Piedmont united to the French state, and divided it into six departements. The decree also made the French language obligatory. Pinerolo became part of the Department of Eridanus, and four Administrators General of the department were named; Pinerolo received a Sub-Prefect, who held office until the Bourbon Restoration in 1814. By a decree of 31 August 1802, religious corporations were abolished, and the Augustinians, the Capuchins, the Clarisses, and the Feuillants were expelled. The Salesian Sisters had already been ordered from their monastery in 1799. The Badia of Santa Maria was closed, and the church of San Francesco, which was in bad condition, was sold at public auction in 1802, and razed to the ground; its tombs, including that of Duke Carlo I of Savoy, were despoiled. On 11 September 1803 a Senatus Consultum made the annexation of Piedmont to the French state permanent.


Following the Concordat of 1801 between Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the Pope issued a bull, Gravissimis causis (1 June 1803), in which the number of dioceses in Piedmont was reduced to eight: Turin, Vercelli, Ivrea, Acqui, Asti, Mondovi, Alessandria and Saluzzo. In 1805, by an imperial decree of the Emperor of the French, Napoleon I Bonaparte, the papal bull was put into effect and the diocese of Pinerolo was suppressed, and its territory merged into the diocese of Saluzzo.


On 2 April 1808 two major earthquakes struck the western Piedmont, with Pinerolo close to the epicenter. More than 400 houses were rendered unlivable. Aftershocks continued for seven months.


After the defeat of Napoleon and the return of Pope Pius VII from his French imprisonment, the Congress of Vienna promoted the restoration of the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Papal States (with some exceptions) to their rightful owners. In both cases the chaos caused by the French occupation had to be undone, and both Victor Emanuel I and Pius VII needed support in asserting their legitimacy and authority. Through Count Giuseppe Barbaroux, the envoy of the King, and Cardinal Enrico Consalvi, the Papal Secretary of State, it was agreed that a reorganization of the Church in the Piedmont was essential. The culmination of negotiations was a bull issued by the Pope on 17 July 1817, Beati Petri, which was promulgated in November, fortified by the royal Exequatur and a decree of the Royal Senate, re-erecting all of the dioceses in the Piedmont and redrawing their diocesan boundaries. In Pinerolo the proclamation was carried out by Msgr Pietro Antonio Cirio, Canon of the Cathedral Chapter of Turin and Subdelegatus Apostolicus, on 9 November 1817. An inscribed tablet on the faÃ§ade of the Cathedral of S. Donato commemorates the event.


On 15 January 1818 Bishop Bigex reopened the Major Seminary, and established a minor seminary which was later converted into the collegio concitto civico.


A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.


The first diocesan synod was held by Bishop d'OrliÃ© on 14â16 September 1762, and dealt with all the usual topics, especially the administration of the sacraments (ordering specially that the Blessed Sacrament be kept at the high altar of each church) and the conduct of the clergy (who were specially forbidden to play the high-stakes gambling card game called bassetta). Sixty-seven synodal examiners were appointed. The statutes of the synod remained in force until 1842.


Bishop FranÃ§ois-Marie Bigex held a diocesan synod in Pinerolo in the Cathedral of S. Donato from 21â23 September 1819. The participants included the Father Guardian and the Vicar of the Capucins, the only religious order of men which had been re-established at the time. In the last session of the synod, there was unexpected dissension on the part of some of the clergy at the severity of the new canons.


Another synod was held from 21â21 September 1842 by Bishop Andreas Charvaz. whose statutes provided an example for the rest of northern Italy of rigor without severity and without excessive indulgence tending toward licence. The conversion of the Waldenses was promoted, and warnings were issued about unauthorized Italian translations of the Bible, containing controversial passages and interpretations. The authority of the pope as supreme pastor in the entire world was defended.


In 2014, the diocese of Pinerolo pastorally served approximately 79,000 Catholics (82.3% of a total population of approximately 96,000) in 62 parishes with 89 priests (64 diocesan, 25 religious), 16 deacons, 222 lay religious (30 brothers, 192 sisters) and 10 seminarians. On 3 March 2018 the Bishop of Pinerolo ordained two new priests.


The 62 parishes (by municipality) are all within the Piedmontese province of Turin The Diocese of Pinerolo maintains a list of its parishes on its website.

10454107,"Dragon Hall, Norwich","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Hall,_Norwich","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dragon_Hall,_Norwich&action=info","Dragon Hall is a Grade-1 listed medieval merchant's trading hall located in King Street, Norwich, Norfolk, close to the River Wensum, and since 2018 home to the National Centre for Writing. It is thought to be unique in being the only such trading hall in Northern Europe to be owned by one man. The building stands on what was the main road through the city in the 15th century, with river transport links via Great Yarmouth to the Low Countries. Dragon Hall is now acknowledged as one of Norwichâs medieval architectural gems and an iconic building in the city.


The Great Hall on the first floor was built in the 15th century, but some parts of the site are older. Archaeological research shows evidence of an Anglo-Saxon hut c.1000 beneath the Hall. On the northern part of the site, in the late 13th century, the abbey at Woburn, Bedfordshire, had a fish processing operation with various outbuildings and a track to a staithe or quay. There was also a boundary wall with a large brick arch to give access to King Street. In about 1330 an L-shaped domestic 'hall house' owned by John Page was built on the southern part of the site with an undercroft and an entrance on the south side from Old Barge Yard.


In about 1427 Robert Toppes, a Norwich merchant, re-developed the site as a commercial complex. He built his first floor trading hall on top of part of the 14th century domestic hall house and on top of the existing boundary wall and brick arch. He retained the 14th century entrance to the hall house for his customers. From the entrance passage his customers went up a new staircase to the first floor trading hall. This was a timber construction of seven bays with a crown post roof, decorated with carvings in the spandrels of 14 dragons. The hall was constructed with English oak, using some 1,000 trees. At the rear of the building he created a yard space with access to the river for his imports and exports, a warehouse area under the hall and a new stairway down to the extended undercroft from the yard. Part of the hall house was retained as a ground floor reception area.


Little is known of Robert Toppes, who during the 1420s bought the land where Dragon Hall now stands. He was an exporter of worsted and an importer of finished textiles, iron goods, wine and spices.
He rose to become an important figure in the politics of the city of Norwich, becoming the city's Treasurer before he was 30, and later becoming Sheriff. He became mayor on four separate occasions and represented the city as its member of parliament four times. He was involved a disputed election which resulted in him exiled to Bristol. and was indicted in the aftermath of the 'Gladman's Insurrection'.


Toppes' second wife, Joan Knyvett, was related to the Pastons, who were linked with the Paston Letters. He owned numerous properties throughout East Anglia. He  paid for a large stained-glass window in the church of St Peter Mancroft, panels of which have survived. When he died in 1467, he provided priests to pray for his soul, paying for this by the sale of his property on King Street.


After being sold in 1467, the hall was gradually divided into smaller and smaller houses, and the original bay windows were replaced with doors and sash windows. The internal structure was redesigned, with the insertion of new floors and cellars. The building became known as the Old Barge Building, named after the nearby pub. Poor quality housing built up around the spaces adjoining the building. By the 19th century some 150 people were known be living there. 


In 1937 a Slum Clearance programme was implemented, which removed most of the slum housing at the back of the site. By the 1950s the front of the hall building looking onto King Street had been adapted for use as a butcher's shop, with a rectory situated behind it, and the Old Barge pub at the southern end. In 1954 the building it was warded Listed Building status: Grade 1.


Following deeper examination by the Norwich Survey, based at the University of East Anglia, architectural historians and other interested people realised that the building was of great historical importance and a committee was set up to restore the hall. In 1979 Norwich City Council bought the building which was by then uninhabited and a major programme of fund raising, restoration and research began. The Norfolk and Norwich Heritage Trust was formed to run the hall; partition walls, attic floors, chimneys and fireplaces were removed and the hall was restored to something like its original state. In 1986 it was renamed as 'Dragon Hall' and became a heritage attraction, a resource for the local community and an educational centre. In 1997/98 there was a major archaeological investigation of the area behind the Hall. Following a major Heritage Lottery Fund grant in 2005/06, further improvements were made, including the addition of a north wing with displays, a lift, offices, a kitchen and a meeting room.


In 2015 the lease of the premises was taken over by the Writersâ Centre Norwich, and in 2016 the Norfolk and Norwich Heritage Trust was wound up. In 2018 the Writers Centre Norwich became the National Centre for Writing, and they added a new North Wing with extensive office and meeting spaces. An existing 19th century cottage on the site was also converted as a residential facility for visiting writers and translators. The Dragon Hall Volunteers were re-constituted as the Dragon Hall Heritage Volunteers and they continue to act as tour guides, to give external talks to local clubs and societies and to act as guardians and promoters of the heritage of Dragon Hall by the creation of an on-line archive of documents and photographs. They also have a Local History Study Group and a Mummers group.


Bookable, guided tours of Dragon Hall are normally available twice a month. On the Heritage Open Days in September, additional tours have in previous years been organised, and special tours and bookings by groups can also be arranged.",1,4 April 2007, 21 June 2021,110,0,0

92193,Circular dichroism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dichroism,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circular_dichroism&action=info,"Circular dichroism (CD) is dichroism involving circularly polarized light, i.e., the differential absorption of left- and right-handed light. Left-hand circular (LHC) and right-hand circular (RHC) polarized light represent two possible spin angular momentum states for a photon, and so circular dichroism is also referred to as dichroism for spin angular momentum.  This phenomenon was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Biot, Augustin Fresnel, and AimÃ© Cotton in the first half of the 19th century. Circular dichroism and circular birefringence are manifestations of optical activity. It is exhibited in the absorption bands of optically active chiral molecules. CD spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in many different fields. Most notably, UV CD is used to investigate the secondary structure of proteins. UV/Vis CD is used to investigate charge-transfer transitions. Near-infrared CD is used to investigate geometric and electronic structure by probing metal dâd transitions. Vibrational circular dichroism, which uses light from the infrared energy region, is used for structural studies of small organic molecules, and most recently proteins and DNA.


Electromagnetic radiation consists of an electric

 field that oscillate perpendicular to one another and to the propagating direction, a transverse wave. While linearly polarized light occurs when the electric field vector oscillates only in one plane, circularly polarized light occurs when the direction of the electric field vector rotates about its propagation direction while the vector retains constant magnitude. At a single point in space, the circularly polarized-vector will trace out a circle over one period of the wave frequency, hence the name. The two diagrams below show the electric field vectors of linearly and circularly polarized light, at one moment of time, for a range of positions; the plot of the circularly polarized electric vector forms a helix along the direction of propagation

. For left circularly polarized light (LCP) with propagation towards the observer, the electric vector rotates counterclockwise. For right circularly polarized light (RCP), the electric vector rotates clockwise.

Simply put, since circularly polarized light itself is ""chiral"", it interacts differently with chiral molecules. That is, the two types of circularly polarized light are absorbed to different extents. In a CD experiment, equal amounts of left and right circularly polarized light of a selected wavelength are alternately radiated into a (chiral) sample. One of the two polarizations is absorbed more than the other one, and this wavelength-dependent difference of absorption is measured, yielding the CD spectrum of the sample. Due to the interaction with the molecule, the electric field vector of the light traces out an elliptical path after passing through the sample.


It is important that the chirality of the molecule can be conformational rather than structural. That is, for instance, a protein molecule with a helical secondary structure can have a CD that changes with changes in the conformation.


By definition,

{\displaystyle \Delta A}

 is a function of wavelength, so for a measurement to be meaningful the wavelength at which it was performed must be known.


It can also be expressed, by applying Beer's law, as:

Î
Îµ


{\displaystyle \Delta \varepsilon }

 is a function of wavelength, a molar circular dichroism value (



Î
Îµ


{\displaystyle \Delta \varepsilon }

) must specify the wavelength at which it is valid.


In many practical applications of circular dichroism (CD), as discussed below, the measured CD is not simply an intrinsic property of the molecule, but rather depends on the molecular conformation. In such a case the CD may also be a function of temperature, concentration, and the chemical environment, including solvents. In this case the reported CD value must also specify these other relevant factors in order to be meaningful.


In ordered structures lacking two-fold rotational symmetry, optical activity, including differential transmission (and reflection) of circularly polarized waves also depends on the propagation direction through the material. In this case, so-called extrinsic 3d chirality is associated with the mutual orientation of light beam and structure.


Although 



Î
A


{\displaystyle \Delta A}

 is usually measured, for historical reasons most measurements are reported in degrees of ellipticity.
Molar ellipticity is circular dichroism corrected for concentration. Molar circular dichroism and molar ellipticity,

, are readily interconverted by the equation:


This relationship is derived by defining the ellipticity of the polarization as:

 in radians. Since the intensity or irradiance,

Then by substituting for I using Beer's law in natural logarithm form:


The ellipticity can now be written as:


Since

 in comparison with unity and converting from radians to degrees:


The linear dependence of solute concentration and pathlength is removed by defining molar ellipticity as,


Then combining the last two expression with Beer's law, molar ellipticity becomes:


The units of molar ellipticity are historically (degÂ·cm2/dmol). To calculate molar ellipticity, the sample concentration (g/L), cell pathlength (cm), and the molecular weight (g/mol) must be known.


If the sample is a protein, the mean residue weight (average molecular weight of the amino acid residues it contains) is often used in place of the molecular weight, essentially treating the protein as a solution of amino acids. Using mean residue ellipticity facilitates comparing the CD of proteins of different molecular weight; use of this normalized CD is important in studies of protein structure.


Methods for estimating secondary structure in polymers, proteins and polypeptides in particular, often require that the measured molar ellipticity spectrum be converted to a normalized value, specifically a value independent of the polymer length. Mean residue ellipticity is used for this purpose; it is simply the measured molar ellipticity of the molecule divided by the number of monomer units (residues) in the molecule.


In general, this phenomenon will be exhibited in absorption bands of any optically active molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by biological molecules, because of their dextrorotary and levorotary components. Even more important is that a secondary structure will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the alpha helix of proteins and the double helix of nucleic acids have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.  The capacity of CD to give a representative structural signature makes it a powerful tool in modern biochemistry with applications that can be found in virtually every field of study.


CD is closely related to the optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) technique, and is generally considered to be more advanced. CD is measured in or near the absorption bands of the molecule of interest, while ORD can be measured far from these bands. CD's advantage is apparent in the data analysis. Structural elements are more clearly distinguished since their recorded bands do not overlap extensively at particular wavelengths as they do in ORD. In principle, these two spectral measurements can be interconverted through an integral transform (KramersâKronig relation), if all the absorptions are included in the measurements.


The far-UV (ultraviolet) CD spectrum of proteins can reveal important characteristics of their secondary structure. CD spectra can be readily used to estimate the fraction of a molecule that is in the alpha-helix conformation, the beta-sheet conformation, the beta-turn conformation, or some other (e.g. random coil) conformation. These fractional assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature or of the concentration of denaturing agents, e.g. Guanidinium chloride or urea. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Also, there are a number of other uses for CD spectroscopy in protein chemistry not related to alpha-helix fraction estimation. Moreover, CD spectroscopy has been used in bioinorganic interface studies. Specifically it has been used to analyze the differences in secondary structure of an  engineered protein before and after titration with a reagent.


The near-UV CD spectrum (>250Â nm) of proteins provides information on the tertiary structure. The signals obtained in the 250â300Â nm region are due to the absorption, dipole orientation and the nature of the surrounding environment of the phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine (or S-S disulfide bridges) and tryptophan amino acids. Unlike in far-UV CD, the near-UV CD spectrum cannot be assigned to any particular 3D structure. Rather, near-UV CD spectra provide structural information on the nature of the prosthetic groups in proteins, e.g., the heme groups in hemoglobin and cytochrome c.


Visible CD spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study metalâprotein interactions and can resolve individual dâd electronic transitions as separate bands. CD spectra in the visible light region are only produced when a metal ion is in a chiral environment, thus, free metal ions in solution are not detected. This has the advantage of only observing the protein-bound metal, so pH dependence and stoichiometries are readily obtained. Optical activity in transition metal ion complexes have been attributed to configurational, conformational and the vicinal effects. Klewpatinond and Viles (2007) have produced a set of empirical rules for predicting the appearance of visible CD spectra for Cu2+ and Ni2+ square-planar complexes involving histidine and main-chain coordination.


CD gives less specific structural information than X-ray crystallography and protein NMR spectroscopy, for example, which both give atomic resolution data. However, CD spectroscopy is a quick method that does not require large amounts of proteins or extensive data processing. Thus CD can be used to survey a large number of solvent conditions, varying temperature, pH, salinity, and the presence of various cofactors.


CD spectroscopy is usually used to study proteins in solution, and thus it complements methods that study the solid state. This is also a limitation, in that many proteins are embedded in membranes in their native state, and solutions containing membrane structures are often strongly scattering. CD is sometimes measured in thin films.


CD spectroscopy has also been done using semiconducting materials such as TiO2 to obtain large signals in the UV range of wavelengths, where the electronic transitions for biomolecules often occur.


CD has also been studied in carbohydrates, but with limited success due to the experimental difficulties associated with measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the spectrum (100â200Â nm), where the corresponding CD bands of unsubstituted carbohydrates lie. Substituted carbohydrates with bands above the VUV region have been successfully measured.


Measurement of CD is also complicated by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit differential absorption of circularly polarized light. Phosphate, sulfate, carbonate, and acetate buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10â50 mM range. The TRIS buffer system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. Borate and Onium compounds are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments. Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Another, almost universal, technique is to minimize solvent absorption by using shorter path length cells when working in the far UV, 0.1Â mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work.


In addition to measuring in aqueous systems, CD, particularly far-UV CD, can be measured in organic solvents e.g. ethanol, methanol, trifluoroethanol (TFE). The latter has the advantage to induce structure formation of proteins, inducing beta-sheets in some and alpha helices in others, which they would not show under normal aqueous conditions. Most common organic solvents such as acetonitrile, THF, chloroform, dichloromethane are however, incompatible with far-UV CD.


It may be of interest to note that the protein CD spectra used in secondary structure estimation are related to the Ï to Ï* orbital absorptions of the amide bonds linking the amino acids. These absorption bands lie partly in the so-called vacuum ultraviolet (wavelengths less than about 200Â nm). The wavelength region of interest is actually inaccessible in air because of the strong absorption of light by oxygen at these wavelengths. In practice these spectra are measured not in vacuum but in an oxygen-free instrument (filled with pure nitrogen gas).


Once oxygen has been eliminated, perhaps the second most important technical factor in working below 200Â nm is to design the rest of the optical system to have low losses in this region. Critical in this regard is the use of aluminized mirrors whose coatings have been optimized for low loss in this region of the spectrum.


The usual light source in these instruments is a high pressure, short-arc xenon lamp. Ordinary xenon arc lamps are unsuitable for use in the low UV. Instead, specially constructed lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic fused silica must be used.


Light from synchrotron sources has a much higher flux at short wavelengths, and has been used to record CD down to 160Â nm. In 2010 the CD spectrophotometer at the electron storage ring facility ISA at the University of Aarhus in Denmark was used to record solid state CD spectra down to 120Â nm.
At the quantum mechanical level, the feature density of circular dichroism and optical rotation are identical. Optical rotary dispersion and circular dichroism share the same quantum information content.",5,26 September 2002, 25 August 2021,408,0,0
10573068,Nordstrand Station,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrand_Station,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nordstrand_Station&action=info,"Nordstrand Station (Norwegian: Nordstrand stasjon) is a railway station on the Ãstfold Line. It is located in the Nordstrand borough of Oslo, Norway. Situated 5.95 kilometers (3.70Â mi) from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), it features an island platform. Nordstrand is served by the Line L2 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, providing two services each hour.


The station opened on 31 May 1880, a year after the Ãstfold Line. The station allowed the area to be opened up for residences and commuting. As traffic grew, a station building was erected around 1895. The station and line past the station was upgraded during the 1920. The station has been unmanned since 1970. It was the site of the Nordstrand Accident on 3 October 1993.


Nordstrand did not receive a railway station when the Ãstfold Line opened on 2 January 1879. Instead passengers had to walk to Bekkelaget Station or Ljan Station. Later that year a commuter rail service started to Bekkelaget, and was extended to Ljan in 1880. In conjunction with this a simple halt was established at Nordstrand. An innovation in Norway, it consisted a single platform which allowed passengers to embark and disembark. The station opened on 31 May 1880. A more extensive commuter rail program was introduced in 1883.
 The station was upgraded and manned from 1884.


The arrival of the railway placed Nordstrand comfortably within commuting distance of the capital. It therefore became a popular site to build houses. Several of the farms in the area sold off otherwise unproductive lots with good views and a short walk to the station. Much of the sales were carried out by speculators who bought farmland and sold them onward to settlers. Throughout the 1890s the population increased, leading to a steady increase in the number of commuter trains to Lian. They originally used 14 minutes to Christiania East Station. A post office was opened at the station in 1891.


The station building was designed by Paul Due and was completed around 1895. During the single-track era the railway did not divide the area in two in the same way as it did later. Passengers could board or disembark on both sides of the train. There were no level crossings, although there was an underpass south of the station. As part of an effort to increase the capacity on the commuter section, the line past Nordstrand was converted to double track from 1 June 1924. Ahead of this the main station building was expanded with an annex which featured a post office. An interlocking system became operational from 20 January 1927. This was followed up by electrification on 9 December 1936.


The station became unmanned from 1970. The station building was subsequently rebuilt and converted into apartments. The station exterior was clad in fiber cement in the hopes of eliminating maintenance. NSB considered closing the station in 1987 to speed up train times for travelers from further south, but the proposal never materialized. The station was largely left to decay and by the early 1990s was in poor condition. NSB then removed the fiber cement and renovated the building.


The Nordstrand Accident took place on 3 October 1993. An uncontrolled NS Class 6400 shunter crashed into an NSB Class 69 commuter train which was standing still at the station. Five people died in the collision.


Nordstrand Station is situated 5.95 kilometers (3.70Â mi) from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of 40 meters (130Â ft) above mean sea level. The Ãstfold Line past Nordstrand is double track and electrified. The station has an island platform, accessed from an overpass on the north side. It is 153 meters (502Â ft) long and 43 centimeters (17Â in) tall. There is limited car parking. Platforms are only accessible via stairs.


The two-story, wooden station building was designed by Paul Due in a moderate Neoclassic style. In addition to the original 169 square meters (1,820Â sqÂ ft) station building, there was a cargo building, a wood shed and a covered overpass to the platform.


The station is served by line L2 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, operated by Vy. During regular hours this involves two trains per hour per direction which run from Ski Station via the Ãstfold Line to Oslo Central Station and onward to SkÃ¸yen Station. Nordstrand is not served by the L2x express services. Travel time is 6 minutes to Oslo S and 28 minutes to Ski.


Despite the double track, the Ãstfold Line past Ljan has reached its capacity limitation due to the mix of commuter, regional and freight trains. The Follo Line is scheduled for completion in 2021. It will allow regional trains to bypass the Ãstfold Line between Oslo and Ski, freeing up capacity. This will allow the L2 service to increase to at least four hourly services from the early 2020s.",1,10 April 2007, 19 December 2020,35,0,0
18583225,Buffer analysis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_analysis,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buffer_analysis&action=info,"In geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis, buffer analysis is the determination of a zone around a geographic feature containing locations that are within a specified distance of that feature, the buffer zone (or just buffer). A buffer is likely the most commonly used tool within the proximity analysis methods.


The buffer operation has been a core part of GIS functionality since the original integrated GIS software packages of the late 70s and early 80s, such as ARC/INFO, Odyssey, and MOSS. Although it is has been one of the most widely used GIS operations in subsequent years, in a wide variety of applications, there has been little published research on the tool itself, except for the occasional development of a more efficient algorithm.


The fundamental method to create a buffer around a geographic feature stored in a  vector data model, with a given radius r is as follows:


Software implementations of the buffer operation typically use alterations of this strategy to process more efficiently and accurately.


Traditional implementations assumed the buffer was being created on a planar  cartesian coordinate space (i.e., created by a map projection) using Euclidean geometry, because the mathematics and computation involved is relatively simple, which was important given the computing power available in the late 1970s. Due to the inherent distortions caused by map projections, the buffer computed this way will not be identical to one drawn on the surface of the Earth; at a local scale, the difference is negligible, but at smaller scales, the error can be significant. 


Some current software, such as Esri ArcGIS Pro and turf, offer the option to compute buffers using geodesic distance, using a similar algorithm but calculated using spherical trigonometry, including representing the lines between vertices as great circles. Other implementations use a workaround by first reprojecting the feature to a projection that minimizes distortion in that location, then computing the planar buffer.


GIS software may offer variations on the basic algorithm, which may be useful in different applications:

Hong Kong granted an invitation from ISSF to send Chen Haohui in the men's rapid fire pistol to the Olympics, as long as the minimum qualifying score (MQS) was fulfilled by June 6, 2021.


However, Chen Haohui did not participate in the games. This is due to his resident status in Hong Kong was not fulfilled and was one to two months shy of the 7 years required to acquire the Hong Kong SAR Passport, and thus the Hong Kong Shooting AssocaitionÂ [zh] had rejected the invitation from the ISSF.


Hong Kong swimmers further achieved qualifying standards in the following events (up to a maximum of 2 swimmers in each event at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST)):

20860346,National Liberal Federation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberal_Federation,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Liberal_Federation&action=info,"The National Liberal Federation (1877â1936) was the union of all English and Welsh (but not Scottish) Liberal Associations. It held an annual conference which was regarded as being representative of the opinion of the party's rank and file and was broadly the equivalent of a present-day party conference.


The inaugural conference of the National Liberal Federation (NLF) was held in Bingley Hall, Birmingham, on 31 May 1877, with the objective of promoting Liberalism, encouraging the formation of new associations and the strengthening and democratising of existing local Liberal parties. The conference was chaired by Joseph Chamberlain and addressed by Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone. New associations quickly formed throughout the country and affiliated to the NLF which was a coordinating body rather than one which operated a central control.


The task of the NLF was ""to form new Liberal Associations based on popular representation"". While the NLF always insisted the policies recommended by the members at its conferences were never intended to be binding on the Liberal leadership, it was obvious that the resolutions passed were a strong indication of thinking and feeling in the mass party which the leadership ignored at its peril. For example, in 1914 the NLF came out in support of women's suffrage, and H. H. Asquith (who was personally opposed to the measure) decided it should receive government support.


The NLF's early associations were with the city of Birmingham. Its structure â which became known as the ""Caucus"" â was modelled on that of the Birmingham Liberal Association, founded in 1865, which had been so effective in building a mass membership and an efficient electioneering body in the city under the political leadership of Joseph Chamberlain, and drawing on the strategic and organisational skills of William Harris (secretary 1868â73) and Francis Schnadhorst (secretary 1873â84). At the establishment of the NLF, Chamberlain was elected its president (1877â80), Harris its chairman (1877â82), Schnadhorst its salaried secretary (1877â93), and John Skirrow Wright, another Birmingham activist, its treasurer (1877â1880).


In the Liberal split over Irish Home Rule the NLF was loyal to party leader Gladstone rather than its own progenitor Joseph Chamberlain, who left the Liberal party and formed the Liberal Unionist faction and coalition with Conservatives.  However, in its political orientation generally the NLF conference tended to take the Radical approach, most clearly in its support of the Newcastle Programme in 1891 (see below). Here it endorsed the extension of the Factory Acts, the introduction of universal male suffrage, an end to plural voting and the reform of the House of Lords. This brought conflict with Gladstone until his retirement from politics in 1894. However, by 1900 the role of the NLF had become merely advisory in term of policy.


There was always the possibility of a clash between the NLF and the Liberal Central Association (LCA), the body (first known as the Liberal Registration Association) which had been formed on 21 February 1860 by twenty Liberal MPs to promote general co-operation between MPs and organisation in the constituencies. It changed its name to the LCA in 1874 and re-modelled its structure and purpose to become the ""central medium of communication with and between the Party throughout the whole kingdom in aid of and in connection with local organization"". The chairman of the LCA was originally the Leader of the Liberal MPs but by the end of the 19th century it was the Liberal Chief Whip. As the 19th century wore on, the role of the LCA changed from that of a members' association to that of a Liberal Whips' Office. It put local Liberal Associations in touch with potential candidates and made grants of money to help with elections. It had no policy role but supporters of various factions within the party did try to capture the offices of the LCA from time to time, most notably in the dissensions in the party over imperialism.


The likelihood of a clash between LCA and NLF was greatly reduced when the NLF moved to London in 1886 into premises at 42 Parliament Street, next door to the LCA offices which were located at 41 Parliament Street. It also helped that Francis Schnadhorst, the efficient political organiser and secretary of the NLF was also appointed secretary of the LCA.


The NLF produced some political literature early in its history. However, in 1887 the NLF and LCA collaborated in the establishment of the new Liberal Publications Department, and these three organisations subsequently worked closely together at the administrative heart of the party.


After the split between the party and Chamberlain over Home Rule, and the support the NLF offered to Gladstone, the NLF began to be more fully aware of the influence it was acquiring. This culminated with the Newcastle Programme of 1891, designed to be a co-ordinated programme of policies for radical reform springing from the grass-roots of the party â a manifesto for the next general election.


Organisationally the NLF was the pillar of the Liberal Party. Under the presidency of Augustine Birrell it played an important role in the Liberal landslide election victory of 1906. It was active in promoting the Free Trade campaign after 1903 and through the work of Robert Hudson helped put in place a number of local pacts with the newly founded Labour Representation Committee.  During the First World War, despite the opposition of many Liberals, the NLF helped to rally recruitment to the armed forces. After 1918 the NLF began to experience some financial difficulties but was able to remain solvent under the presidencies of Sir George Lunn and J. M. Robertson. They, together with secretary Robert Hudson, remained staunch supporters of H. H. Asquith and as a result Lloyd George had to keep his own National Liberal organisation in place between 1918 and 1922. When Asquith died and Lloyd George became party leader in 1926, Hudson who was by then NLF Treasurer, resigned.


The NLF continued in being until 1936 when an internal review of party organisation under Lord Meston recommended its replacement with a body with a different remit, the Liberal Party Organisation.

The first generation used either nickel-iron or nickel-cadmium batteries. Only 56 were produced and were sold for approximately $120,000 each. Half were produced using nickel-iron batteries and half were equipped with the nickel-cadmium packs. The TEVan was built on the same production line as the gasoline-powered minivans at Chrysler's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada. It had a top speed of 70Â mph (110Â km/h), seating for five adults, and a curb weight of 5,060Â lb (2,295Â kg). The second generation, named the EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), was launched in 1997 with advanced lead acid batteries and later in 1998 with nickel metal-hydride batteries. It was offered for lease in New York and California in 1999.


The 180V nickel-cadmium pack consisted of 30 SAFT STM5-180 6V 180Ah batteries in six removable pods under the floor of the car, delivering over 50 miles (80Â km) of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance. The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6V 200Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over 60 miles (97Â km) of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated 80 miles (130Â km) of range.


The TEVan's on-board charger was a PFC Martin-Marietta and accepted 120 VAC@20A or 40A, 240 VAC@20A or 40A, and as high as 220 VAC@40A- three-phase inputs.


The TEVan used a 27Â hp, 65Â hp max (48Â kW) Separately-Excited GE DC traction motor coupled to a two-speed FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual referred to it as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE. The EPIC used an AC traction motor and single speed transmissions.

The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) is a non-departmental public body of the Home Office of the United Kingdom. The DBS enables organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors to make safer recruitment decisions by identifying candidates who may be unsuitable for certain work, especially involving children or vulnerable adults, and provides wider access to criminal record information through its disclosure service for England and Wales.


The DBS was formed in 2012 by merging the functions of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. The DBS started operating on 1 December 2012. It operates from Liverpool and Royal Wootton Bassett. Its equivalent agencies are Disclosure Scotland in Scotland and Access Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland, although convictions from every part of the UK appear on it.


It is a legal requirement in the UK for regulated activity employers to notify the DBS if a person leaves or changes their job in relation to having harmed someone. It is an offence for any person who has been barred by the DBS to work or apply to work in Regulated Activity (whether paid or voluntary) with the group (children or adults) from which they are barred. It is also an offence for an employer to knowingly employ a barred person in regulated activity with the group from which they are barred.


An organisation which is entitled to ask exempted questions (under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974) must register with the DBS, or a registered DBS Umbrella Body before they can request a DBS check on an applicant.[citation needed] The applicant applies to the DBS with their application countersigned by the DBS Registered Organisation or Umbrella Body.[citation needed] The applicant's criminal record is then accessed from the Police National Computer (PNC), as well as checked, if appropriate, against lists of people considered unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable people maintained by the DBS (formerly maintained by the Independent Safeguarding Authority.[citation needed] A copy of the completed certificate is sent to the applicant's home address.


If an individual or organisation has safeguarding concerns regarding a member of staff, they can make a safeguarding referral to the DBS who will work with multiple agencies to assess whether that individual should be Barred from working in regulated activity with children and/or vulnerable groups.


The Criminal Records Bureau was established under Part V of the Police Act 1997 and was launched in March 2002, following public concern about the safety of children, young people and vulnerable adults.[citation needed] It was found that the British police forces did not have adequate capability or resources to routinely process and fulfil the large number of criminal record checks requested in a timely fashion, so a dedicated agency was set up to administer this function.


Employers and temporary staff agencies have bemoaned the time it takes for a worker to be cleared by the DBS and in an effort to cut waiting times the government allowed the establishment of ""Adult First"" .[citation needed]


In May 2002, the Department for Education began maintaining a list of individuals who are not suitable to work with children. This list was originally named List 99, later named the ISA Children's Barred List (maintained by the Independent Safeguarding Authority) and finally, the DBS Children's Barred List (maintained by the Disclosure and Barring Service.


Under the Care Standards Act (2000), the Department for Health introduced an adult version of List 99 named 'POVA first' on 26 July 2004, this was later renamed 'ISA Adult First' and finally; 'DBS Adult First'. The Adult first and List 99 services allow registered bodies (when eligible) to check whether an applicant appears on the DBS Adults' or Children's Barred List through the online checking system, this takes around two working days to turn around. If the check is clean the organisation may provisionally employ the applicant, subject to an increased level in supervision, until the return by post of the full disclosure.[citation needed]


On 17 June 2013, a DBS update service was launched, intended to improve the ease of applying for criminal record checks and create significant savings.[citation needed]


On 1 February 2018, the National Audit Office published an investigation report that was highly critical of the DBS.


In 2009, the Home Office launched a programme to increase the efficiency of safeguarding services. Key aims of the programme were to reduce the cost of running the disclosure service, through customers using a new and cheaper update service rather than continuing to use existing types of disclosure certificates. The Home Office expected 2.8 million paying users to be using the new update service by 2017â18, but it was not market tested and the actual number of users is around one million.


According to the National Audit Office investigation, the modernisation programme is now running three and a half years late and expected costs have increased by Â£229 million. DBS is currently negotiating with its contractor, Tata Consultancy Services, over the delays.


The modernisation programme and the update service were expected to increase the ease and frequency with which people were checked, thereby improving safeguarding. But the Home Office and DBS do not know how many people have been prevented from working with children or vulnerable adults through use of this information.


The process by which the DBS provides criminal record data is called DBS Certificate or a DBS check (previously CRB check). There are four levels of DBS checks, Basic, Standard, Enhanced and Enhanced with barred list checks (for Basic Disclosures, see Disclosure Scotland). DBS basic checks can be obtained by members of the public but enhanced checks are only available to organisations and only for those professions, offices, employments, work and occupations listed in the Exceptions Order (1975) to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974  as amended by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. In January 2018 ""Basic"" DBS checks were introduced which will disclose details of any cautions or convictions deemed to be unspent in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.


The basic DBS check will disclose any convictions or conditional cautions deemed to be unspent according to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The aim is that this service will reduce the need for unnecessary and ineligible Standard or Enhanced checks. Basic DBS checks can be obtained by the individual online through the DBS website or through a registered third party known as a ""Responsible Organisation"".


The standard DBS check is primarily for positions of high responsibility (for example, accountancy and security). Standard certificates reveal details of any convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings the applicant has received, that do not qualify for filtering. A standard check may only be applied for if the applicant's job role is specified in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975, as amended.


Enhanced DBS checks are for positions involving certain activities such as teaching children or treating adults and can also be obtained for certain other professions (for example, judicial appointments, RSPCA officers). An enhanced check may only be applied for if the applicant's job role is specified in both the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) order 1975 and the Police Act 1997.


In addition to the information provided on a Standard certificate, the Enhanced certificate involves an additional check with the police, who check if any other information is held on file that may be relevant (for instance, information that has not led to a criminal conviction but may indicate a danger to vulnerable groups).  The police decide what (if any) additional information will be added to the certificate using the Quality Assurance Framework.


The involvement of local police forces can mean an enhanced check may take significantly longer than a standard check to be completed.[original research?]


This includes all that Enhanced certificate does, plus a check of the appropriate DBS Barred List. There are two DBS Barred Lists: one for adults, and one for children. The lists contain information on whether the applicant is barred from working with either of the two groups. An individual may only be checked against one or both barred lists if their job role is classified as a ""Regulated Activity"" with children and/or adults under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, as amended.


As of 29Â MayÂ 2013[update], the DBS began to ""filter"" certain criminal information from a DBS certificate if it met the guidelines laid out in The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (Amendment) (England and Wales) Order 2013


On 17 June 2013, the DBS update service was launched, intended to improve the ease of applying for criminal record checks and create significant savings. At a fee of Â£13 a year (or free for volunteers), applicants may use a certificate more than once within a sector where the disclosure level, workforce details, barring list checks and volunteer status are the same; an employer with consent to run a DBS update check and the consent of the subject can, free of charge, check that the existing certificate is up to date, and should check the applicant's identity and the certificate's authenticity.


The DBS work to a number of standards for the criminal record checking service and barring case accuracy.


Performance service standards are also agreed between the 
DBS and Police disclosure units.


The CRB had been due to partner with the ISA in administering the newly created Vetting and Barring Scheme from 2009. This was suspended in 2010 pending a review following the 2010 General Election.


This review was published in February 2011, making recommendations for the merger of the Criminal Records Bureau and Independent Safeguarding Authority into one new non-departmental public body, the Disclosure and Barring Service, responsible for barring individuals and completing criminal record checks. Under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, the DBS does not require registration, nor are any details retained on a database.


The procedures of the CRB were tightened following the Soham murders trial. Ian Huntley, a former caretaker, was found guilty of murdering two girls from a Cambridgeshire primary school in 2002.  Huntley had been suspected of a string of offences including rape, indecent assault and burglary. His only conviction before the murders was for riding an uninsured and unlicensed motorcycle, but a burglary charge had remained on file. In January 2006, following controversies resulting from cases where staff had been hired by schools before a full CRB check had been carried out, the Department for Education and Skills stated: ""Employers should obtain a CRB Enhanced Disclosure in respect of all teachers they recruit before the person is placed in a school."" Huntley had been hired in November 2001, before the CRB came into force.


Sociologist Frank Furedi has stated that CRB checks cannot provide a ""cast-iron guarantee that children will be safe with a particular adult"", and that their use has created an atmosphere of suspicion and is ""poisoning"" relationships between the generations, with many ordinary parents finding themselves regarded as ""potential child abusers"". The restrictions imposed by the CRB check process have allegedly contributed to a shortage of adult volunteers in organizations such as Girlguiding UK.


In 2009 the CRB's Enhanced Disclosure was criticised for including details of any minor contact an individual has had with the police, even where no formal action was taken against them.",4,20 September 2005, 7 September 2021,324,2,1
6792011,Kororoit Creek,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kororoit_Creek,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kororoit_Creek&action=info,"The Kororoit  Creek is a watercourse of the Port Phillip catchment, rising in the outer north western suburbs of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria.


The Kororoit Creek rises below Mount Kororoit, northeast of Melton in the north western outer suburbs of Melbourne. The creek's headwaters are north of Sunbury at approximately 400 metres (1,300Â ft) above sea level in ordovician geology. The creek flows generally south by east and passes over the volcanic lava plain of western Melbourne to its mouth at sea level, north of Altona and emptying into Altona Bay within Port Phillip. The creek is joined by one minor tributary as it descends approximately 407 metres (1,335Â ft) over its 52-kilometre (32Â mi) course. At the outlet in Altona Bay, the creek winds its way through the Altona Coastal Park and then the Jawbone Marine Sanctuary Park, where it enters Port Phillip.


From east of Sunbury, the Kororoit Creek makes its way down through many suburbs towards its mouth, including the towns and suburbs of Rockbank, Caroline Springs, Burnside, Kings Park, Albanvale, Deer Park, Cairnlea, West Sunshine, Ardeer, Albion, Brooklyn and Altona North.


The creek is traversed by the Melton Highway, east of Melton; the Western Highway and the Western Ring Road, at Ardeer; and the West Gate Freeway and Federation Trail at Brooklyn. The Kororoit Creek Trail runs along the banks in the lower reaches of the creek.


The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the creek are the Wurundjeri people who had hunted, fished and camped along the creek for thousands of years. Aboriginal occupation is evident in the form of many scattered artefacts along the creek. Scar trees, where canoes were carved from the bark of the red gums, are dotted along the creek.[citation needed]


European explorers, James Flemming and Charles Grimes identified the Kororoit Creek in 1803,[citation needed] along with the Maribyrnong River and Yarra River.


The Brooklyn Bluestone Bridge was built over the Kororoit Creek at Brooklyn in the 1870s. The bridge was built using bluestone from the local area and still stands. The bridge was one of the first crossings built for gold diggers heading to the gold fields of Ballarat.


Kororoit is an Aboriginal word of the Woiwurrung language that has been used to describe the ""creek on (the) western plain""; with an alternate theory that claims the word to mean a ""male kangaroo"".


The creek is home to significant animal species such as the growling grass frog and the striped legless lizard, as well as migratory birds. Remnant native vegetation also survives in some places, including red river gum and white mangroves. Small parks are located on the east and west borders along the creek. Native reptiles, including tiger snake, eastern blue-tongued lizard, common snakeneck turtle and eastern brown snake were often seen along the creek. Unfortunately due to overdevelopment these species are now rarely seen in some areas. Reptiles found along the creek help to maintain the balance of the populations of small mammals such as water rats and mice that thrive along the banks of the creek. Native species of frogs have taken advantage and reclaimed residences in the new (man-made) wetlands and lakes. The eastern banjo frog, common eastern froglet and even the now endangered growling grass frog have been seen and heard in the new wetlands and around Kororoit Creek, particularly in Cairnlea.


Aquatic species found in the creek include the common galaxias, short-finned eel, Australian smelt, tupong, common carp, eastern bluespot goby, and flathead gudgeon.[citation needed]


Bird species found adjacent to the creek include the Australasian darter, little pied cormorant, brown falcon, peregrine falcon, square-tailed kite, dusky moorhen, royal spoonbill, black swan, Pacific black duck, mallard, Australian wood duck, galah, rainbow lorikeet, white-faced heron, Australian white ibis, and wattlebird.[citation needed]


Both the river blackfish and the platypus are native species that are now believed to be extinct along creek's course.[citation needed]


Common introduced species that can be found adjacent to the creek include the red fox and the European rabbit.[citation needed]

The Martha's Vineyard Railroad was a 3Â ft (914Â mm) narrow gauge railroad on the island of Martha's Vineyard. It was built in 1874 to connect the Oak Bluffs wharf with the section of Edgartown known as Katama. The line closed in 1896.


After the decline of the whale oil industry in the 1860s, the east coast island of Martha's Vineyard sought to develop a tourist trade. As part of this effort a 3Â ft (914Â mm)  gauge railroad was chartered in 1874 to take tourists across the island. The railway started at Oak Bluffs where steamships of the Old Colony Railroad docked and ran southeast along the shore through Edgartown to Katama.


The line was constructed within 8 weeks across the flat, sandy soil and completed by August 7, 1874. Edward R. Dunham of Edgartown built one half of the bridge over the Sengekontacket Pond, while a mainland contractor built the other half. When the two ends met in the middle, a measurement error of more than 2 inches (50 mm) became apparent, for which the contractors blamed each other, before the necessary corrective action was taken.


Fearing that a conventional steam locomotive might frighten horses, the railroad company purchased a dummy, a steam-powered railcar as it was used by the elevated railways in major cities. On August 5, 1874, while thousands were lining the tracks, the dummy began its maiden voyage. But it only made it to the first tight bend, as the chassis could not rotate far enough due to the sprocket and roller chain drive.


Therefore, a conventional H.K. Porter steam locomotive named Active was purchased. On August 17, 1874, it was waiting on a flat car for the journey over the Sound, when some loaded freight cars broke loose and collided with the buffers of the flat car. The flat car stopped on land, but the ten-ton locomotive tipped over into the harbour basin. It was lifted by crane from the muddy bottom of the harbour basin and shipped to Boston to be cleaned and repaired. When it was finally unloaded from the steamboat Island Home at Mattakeset Lodge in Katama via a special loading ramp on August 22, 1874, the summer season was almost over. Decorated with flags, it mastered the route to Edgartown at a brisk pace, which was celebrated as a sensation along the entire route.


In 1876 a short half mile extension from Katama to South Beach was opened, bringing the total length of the line to 9 miles (14Â km).


It is possible to drive most all of the original right-of-way between Oak Bluffs, Edgartown, and Katama (with a few short detours).[pageÂ needed]


The railroad ran into financial problems almost immediately. By 1877 the operation of the line was temporarily turned over to the principal debt holders until it returned to solvency. However the financial problems continued and in 1890 the railroad was placed into receivership. In 1892 a fire destroyed the Sea View House, the wooden ferry dock and the track triangle. Since there was no budget for the reconstruction of the triangle, the train went backwards from Oak Bluffs to Katama.


In early 1892 the railroad was sold to the Old Colony Steamboat Company, the subsidiary of the Old Colony Railroad that operated the steamships to Oak Bluffs. They in turn sold the line to Joseph M. Wardell who became its general manager. The railroad continued to operate at a loss and finally closed in 1896.",0,12 October 2006, 30 May 2021,46,0,0
11098797,Khyber Pass copy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass_copy,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khyber_Pass_copy&action=info,"A Khyber Pass copy is a firearm manufactured by cottage gunsmiths in the Khyber Pass region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.


The area has long had a reputation for producing unlicensed copies of firearms using whatever materials are available; more often than not, railway rails, scrap motor vehicles, and other scrap metal with basic hand tools. The quality of such firearms varies widely, ranging from as good as a factory-produced example to dangerously poor.


The most commonly encountered Khyber Pass copies are of British military firearms, notably MartiniâHenry, MartiniâEnfield, and LeeâEnfield rifles, although AK-47 rifles, Webley Revolvers, Tokarev TT-33s, Colt M1911s and Browning Hi-Powers have also been encountered. In the United States, a Kalashnikov-style rifle composed of a mix of parts from various style AK rifles is sometimes referred to as a Khyber Pass AK because, like Khyber guns, they are unlike any rifle produced by a factory or issued by a regular military force. The typical example of a ""Khyber Pass AK"" is a stamped receiver AKM chambered for the 7.62Ã39mm cartridge, fitted with the triangular folding stock common to Russian AKS-74 rifles.[citation needed]


The Khyber Pass gunsmiths first acquired examples of the various British service arms during nineteenth-century British military expeditions in the North-West Frontier, which they used to make copies. During World War II, some locally organised irregular forces were issued Khyber Pass-made rifles â partly for financial reasons and partly because there was concern the troops would steal their rifles and desert if issued higher-quality British or Indian manufactured rifles.


Khyber Pass rifles are usually copied exactly from a ""master"" weapon (which may itself be a Khyber Pass copy), markings and all. It is not uncommon to see Khyber Pass rifles with numerous errors and particular identifying factors, notably:


Afghanistan was a point of conflict between the British Empire and Imperial Russia throughout the 19th century, from which it is reasonable to assume that tools and expertise relevant to both cultures were accumulated by local gunsmiths. Rather than a translation error, a reversed ""N"" or ""L"" in ENFIELD may be the Cyrillic ""Ð"" or ""Ð"" character, with the gunsmith using whichever available letter punch best resembled the original letters.


Not only are there counterfeit weapons, but there is counterfeit ammunition as well. Typically they are based on low-powered modern cartridges. .30 bore cartridges are compatible with 7.63Ã25mm Mauser or 7.62Ã25mm Tokarev. .32 bore cartridges are compatible with .32 Auto Colt Pistol / 7.65mm Browning (7.65Ã17mmSR). 12 bore cartridges are 12 gauge (18.5x70mmR) shotgun shells.


44 bore cartridges are compatible with the 7.92Ã33mm Kurz round for the World War Two era StG 44. Pakistan has a ban on rifles designed to fire military cartridges; the use of the 44 bore cartridge was a loophole in the law until specifically banned in 2012. It was used in AKM copies chambered or modified for it. It was a popular cartridge because it was easy to modify AKMs to fire it but still fed from standard AK magazines. Saquib brand makes 44 bore ammunition.


The ammunition used in the Khyber Pass region is often underloaded, being made from a variety of powders or even old film (which contains nitrocellulose, a key component of smokeless powder); Khyber Pass Copy rifles cannot be expected to withstand the pressures generated by modern commercial ammunition. A few collectors have made extremely mild handloaded cartridges for their Khyber Pass rifles and fired them, at substantial personal risk.[citation needed]


The packaging and headstamps are often forged versions of quality foreign brands like GECO (Gustav Genschow & Co.), Golden Tiger (Vympel IIRC), China Sport (NORINCO), MEN (Metallwerk ElisenhÃ¼tte Nassau), and PPU (Prvi Partizan UÅ¾ice). Local counterfeits have colorful brand-name packaging like Buffalo, Diamond, Double Dragon, Double Star, Federal SKF, Goodluck, Gorilla, and Tiger SBR.


The Khyber Arms Company, a local ammunition manufacturer, makes the Expert or X-Pert brand. It uses counterfeit Winchester ammunition packaging with cartridges stamped with fake NORINCO State Factory 311 headstamps.


New casings and bullet jackets are usually copper-washed steel, like Chinese ammunition. The casings are sometimes recycled from scrounged US or NATO military brass casings. 5.56mm NATO cases are cut-down and reshaped to make .30 bore rounds such as 7.63x25mm Mauser or 7.62x25mm Tokarev. 9Ã19mm Parabellum cases are cut down to make reloaded .380 ACP / 9Ã17mm Short or 9Ã18mm Makarov rounds.",2,7 May 2007, 31 August 2021,164,1,1

To celebrate nine years of the show, the final featured a special performance entitled ""Best of Britainâs Got Talent"", which featured several participants who had appeared on the show during the previous nine series, including Ashleigh and Pudsey, Attraction, Diversity, Jon Clegg, Stavros Flatley, Collabro and Spelbound. It was the last series to have its live episodes broadcast at The Fountain Studios before the site's closure that year.


The tenth series was won by magician Richard Jones, with jazz singer Wayne Woodward finishing in second place, and dance troupe Boogie Storm placing third. During its broadcast, the series averaged around 9.5 million viewers. Although the main programme faced no major incidents, its companion show Britain's Got More Talent caused controversy for incorporating a segment that was later criticised by Simon Cowell.


Following open auditions held between October to December 2015, including an additional one on 10 January 2016, the Judges' auditions took place between January and February 2016, within Liverpool, Birmingham, and London. There were no major incidents amongst the judging panel that forced them to be absent, although Simon Cowell arrived late for the London auditions on 23 January - David Walliams's mother, Kathleen Williams, who was attending these, stood in for him for a number of auditions until he arrived.


Of the participants that took part, only forty-five made it into the five live semi-finals - of these acts, singer Beau Dermott, gospel choir 100 Voices of Gospel, singer Jasmine Elcock, singing duo Anne & Ian Marshall, and dance troupe Boogie Storm, each received a golden buzzer during their auditions - with nine appearing in each one, and twelve of these acts making it into the live final; the Judges' Wildcard was dancing duo Shannon & Peter, who lost the Judges' vote in the second semi-final, while the Public Wildcard was dog act Trip Hazard, who lost the Judges' vote in the final semi-final.


The following below lists the results of each participant's overall performance in this series:

Production staff working on Britain's Got More Talent created controversy after a live episode of the tenth series, when they conducted a segment to celebrate the tenth year of Britain's Got Talent with a special contest. The contest focused on the sister show's host, Stephen Mulhern, asking trivia questions about the main programme and awarding puppies to the judges for each correct answer given. After the segment was completed and the programme entered a commercial break, Simon Cowell became concerned over the well-being of the animals, and criticised staff members for a poorly conceived stunt. While Mulhern had to apologise to viewers for what was shown on television,  Cowell made it clear to the producers that such a stunt would not be repeated.",1,30 December 2015, 20 July 2021,"1,295",0,0

Norway won the event, with Sweden taking the silver medal and Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) bronze.


In the first leg, OAR (Natalia Nepryaeva) and Norway (Ingvild Flugstad Ãstberg) skied together, with Finland (Aino-Kaisa Saarinen) trailing 20 seconds, Sweden (Anna Haag) 25 seconds after, and Switzerland fifth. In the second leg, Sweden (Charlotte Kalla) caught up with OAR (Yulia Belorukova) and they skied together, but Norway (Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen) dropped half a minute behind and was overtaken by Finland (Kerttu Niskanen), ten seconds behind the leaders. Switzerland (Nadine FÃ¤hndrich) was still fifth, but almost caught up with Norway. In the third leg, Norway (Ragnhild Haga) caught up with the leaders, Sweden (Ebba Andersson) and OAR (Anastasia Sedova). Finland was already 40 seconds behind, with other teams seemingly out of medal contention. In the last leg, Anna Nechaevskaya could not match the pace of the leaders, but Krista PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski of Finland was not fast enough to make up forty seconds deficit, and OAR became third. At the finish line, Marit BjÃ¸rgen was faster than Stina Nilsson, thus winning gold for Norway.


In the victory ceremony, the medals were presented by Kristin Kloster Aasen, member of the International Olympic Committee, accompanied by Erik RÃ¸ste, President of the Norwegian Ski Federation.


A total of up to 310 cross-country skiers qualified across all eleven events. Athletes qualified for this event by having met the A qualification standard, which meant having 100 or less FIS Points in either the sprint or distance classification. The Points list takes into average the best results of athletes per discipline during the qualification period (1 July 2016 to 21 January 2018). Countries received additional quotas by having athletes ranked in the top 30 of the FIS Olympics Points list (two per gender maximum, overall across all events). Countries also received an additional quota (one per gender maximum) if an athlete was ranked in the top 300 of the FIS Olympics Points list. After the distribution of B standard quotas, the remaining quotas were distributed using the Olympic FIS Points list, with each athlete only counting once for qualification purposes. A country could only enter the event if it had qualified at least four female athletes, and a country could enter only one team.

3221863,"Cobden, Victoria","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobden,_Victoria","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cobden,_Victoria&action=info","Cobden /ËkÉbdÉn/ is a town located 200 kilometres southwest of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia named in honour of Richard Cobden. At the 2006 census, Cobden had a population of 1,813. At the 2001 census, Cobden had a population of 1,419.


The Cobden area was settled by Europeans in the 1840s by Dr. Daniel Curdie, (1814-1884) a medical doctor from the Isle of Arran, Scotland, who was beloved by local Aboriginal warriors (who had settled their aeons before) for his habit of tending their wounds after tribal skirmishes. In 1840 he settled in the Heytesbury forest area on a small creek not far from where the present day Cobden lies. Dr. Curdie, so overcome by its beauty, christened the area Lovely Banks.
When the town was surveyed in 1861 the area had to be renamed because there was already a place named Lovely Banks in west Geelong. It was decided to call the town Cobden after Richard Cobden (1804-65), an English Parliamentarian and advocate of free trade.


The Cobden Post Office was opened on 6 January 1867.


The Heytesbury Forest attracted logging companies and with them more settlers. Homes were built and stock set to graze on the newly established pasture. In April 1892 a railway was established from Camperdown thru Cobden to Timboon, a plan to extend the line to Port Campbell was never built, the train carried out timber and came back loaded with produce and provisions. The prosperity was not to last however and as the Heytesbury forest was reduced in size, most of it surviving in the Jancourt State Forest, The need for freight trains waned. The last train was in 1987. The line has since been removed, its place taken by a walking trail.


In 1888 Cobden opened the first cheese and butter factory in Victoria. Today the factory still operates, owned by Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, and houses the largest milk drying plant in Australia. Today Cobden and its surrounding area claim to be the ""Dairy Capital"" of the world, a claim based on the over 140,000 head of cattle in and around the area.


The Cobden Magistrates' Court closed on 1 November 1981, not having been visited by a Magistrate since 1976.


Children from the district attend Cobden Primary School or Cobden Technical School.


Part of the reason for the rich soil that surrounds Cobden is its convenient location on the southern border of the Lakes and Craters Country, the fourth largest volcanic plain in the world. Though the volcanoes are dormant, the ash they once spewed has enriched the soil greatly.


The town has an Australian Rules football and netball team playing in the Hampden Football League. The Cobden Bombers was a foundation club of the League and have won 6 premierships.


Golfers play at the Cobden Golf Club on Neylon Street.

6357967,Chopine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopine,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chopine&action=info,"A chopine is a type of women's platform shoe that was popular in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Chopines were originally used as a patten, clog, or overshoe to protect the shoes and dress from mud and street soil.  


Chopines were popularly worn in Venice by both courtesans and patrician women from c. 1400 to 1700. Besides their practical uses, the height of the chopine became a symbolic reference to the cultural and social standing of the wearer; the higher the chopine, the higher the status of the wearer. High chopines allowed a woman to tower over others. During the Renaissance, chopines became an article of women's fashion and were made increasingly taller; some extant examples are over 20Â inches (50Â cm) high. In 1430, the height of chopines was limited by Venetian law to three inches, but this regulation was widely ignored. Shakespeare joked about the extreme height of the chopines in style in his day by using the word altitude (Hamlet 2.2, the prince greets one of the visiting playersÂ â the adolescent boy who would have played the female parts in the all-male troupeÂ â by noting how much ""nearer to heaven"" the lad had grown since he last saw him ""by the altitude of a chopine"").


Surviving chopines are typically made of wood or cork, and those in the Spanish style were sometimes banded about with metal. Extant pieces are covered with leather, brocades, or jewel-embroidered velvet. Often, the fabric of the chopine matched the dress or the shoe, but not always. However, despite being highly decorated, chopines were often hidden under the wearer's skirt and were hidden from any critical observation. Although due to the design of the shoes, they caused the wearer to have a very ""comical walk"".


According to some scholars, chopines caused an unstable and inelegant gait. Noblewomen wearing them were generally accompanied by two servants in order to walk around safely, by supporting themselves on the servants' shoulders. Other scholars have argued that with practice a woman could walk and even dance gracefully. In his dancing manual NobilitÃ  di dame (1600), the Italian dancing master Fabritio Caroso writes that with care a woman practiced in wearing her chopines could move âwith grace, seemliness, and beautyâ and even ""dance flourishes and galliard variations"". Chopines were usually put on with the help of two servants.


In the 15th century, chopines were also the style in Spain. Their popularity in Spain was so great that the larger part of the nation's cork supplies went towards production of the shoes. Some argue[who?] that the style originated in Spain, as there are many extant examples and a great amount of pictorial and written reference going back to the 14th century. Chopines of the Spanish style were more often conical and symmetric, while their Venetian counterparts are much more artistically carved. Turkish sources claim the origin of the ornate Venetian chopines were nalins developed for turkish baths.  That is not to say, however, that Spanish chopines were not adorned; on the contrary, there is evidence of jeweling, gilt lettering along the surround (the material covering the cork or wooden base), tooling, and embroidery on Spanish chopines. 


There are a great many cognates of the word chopine (chapiney, choppins, etc.). However, neither the word chopine nor any word similar to it (chioppino, cioppino, etc.) appears in Florio's dictionaries of either 1598 or 1611. The Italian word, instead, seems to be ""zoccolo"" (English plural: clogs), which likely comes from the Italian word ""zocco"", meaning a stump or a block of wood. Florio does, however, use the word ""chopinos"" in his English definition of zoccoli.",3,9 August 2006, 11 September 2021,69,1,1

The crest represents that prosperity can only be had through Justice.
The palm is prosperity and the crossed swords represent Justice.
 The palm tree represents the Kingdom's assets which are defined as its people, heritage, history, and resources natural and non-natural. Thus, the palm is shown to be guarded by the two swords, which represent the forces to be used in defence of the nation.

The Emblem appears on government documents, diplomatic missions, as well as several Saudi Arabian flags. It is emblazoned in gold on the flag of the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia (which is also the Kingdom's war ensign), and on the lower hoist of the Royal Standard. The latter is essentially the national flag with the added Emblem in gold, which is placed in the lower part of the (left-facing) hoist and not in the canton as with other royal standards. The Emblem's lower position is in deference to the sacred nature of the Shahada, the Islamic creed.

Janaki Nath was born in Kodalia on 28 May 1860 as the third son of Haranath Bose. The gate of the house still stands bearing this name. Although the Bose family of Mahinagar can traces its lineage back to Gopinath Bose who was given the title Purandar Khan by Sultan Hussain Shah, by the time of his birth it had been reduced to modest means. Janaki Nath passed the Entrance examination in December 1877 from Albert School, Kolkata.


A schoolmate at this time was the legendary chemist-cum-industrialist Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray, who as a Professor taught his sons at Presidency College.

11040440,Combination fire department,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_fire_department,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Combination_fire_department&action=info,"A combination fire department is a type of fire department which consists of both career and volunteer firefighters. In the United States, combination fire departments are typically tax-supported in some fashion, and generally have an annual call volume larger than purely volunteer departments but less than career departments.


The career staff assigned to a volunteer station will handle all aspects of daily operations. This includes but is not limited to equipment checks, basic maintenance, firehouse maintenance, etc. The career staff at a station typically do not answer to the volunteer chain of command, but to the jurisdiction they work for. The career staff in a combination fire department staff a station or unit because the volunteers in that station are unable to respond at some or all the hours in a day (volunteer firefighters have traditional jobs/careers that would prevent them from leaving work and responding to every call during working normal business hours). Furthermore, the volunteer organization may not have the manpower to cover all calls and the career staff augments them to provide minimal staffing for preexisting jurisdictional requirements.


Career staff are not in charge of the volunteer fire house. Depending on the staffing requirements, the career staff may be there 24/7, they maintain the station and equipment, but it still belongs to the volunteers.


Volunteer firefighters associated with a combination or volunteer department generally respond to the station or directly to an incident when an emergency call is dispatched. Volunteer firefighters operate in the same range as full-time ""career"" firefighters, responding to fires and in many communities, vehicle accidents, hazardous materials, confined spaces, rescue from water or other situations as well as commonly providing first emergency medical response (prior to the arrival of the ambulances). Some combination departments require their volunteer firefighters to be trained to the same standards as their full-time counterparts. Often career firefighters will start with a combination department to acquire experience, training, and then attempt to get hired in the career service.


Volunteer firefighters are often compensated in one form or another, and those that are paid are often referred to as part paid or paid on-call firefighters. True volunteer firefighters are few in number, as it is economically unfeasible for fire personnel to be compensated for the amount time required for requisite training and for the personal costs of responding to dispatched calls. True volunteer firefighters are not paid for their time, although the U.S. Department of Labor has ruled that under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), volunteer firefighters can be paid a nominal fee up to 20% of the compensation a full-time firefighter would receive. These nominal fees can be based per call or shift or other requirements of service but may not be productivity based as in an hourly wage. After a certain number of years of service, some departments offer pension-like programs called Length of Service Award Programs, and some states offer tax breaks to volunteer firefighters. LOSAP, worker's compensation, liability insurance, disability insurance, expense reimbursement, and other benefits can be offered to volunteers without jeopardizing their volunteer status with the Department of Labor. However, under FLSA, a firefighter working for an employer as a career firefighter may not volunteer their time as a firefighter or fire marshal for the same employer. A volunteer firefighter may volunteer as a firefighter for the same agency only if they are employed in a different role.


Part paid or paid on-call refers to the fact that some volunteer firefighters are only partly compensated and their stipend or pay often do not fully cover the costs associated with being a firefighter, including lost wages from their primary occupation for response to dispatches and training. Their pay may be hourly based and may or may not qualify for volunteer status under FLSA. In addition, many part paid or paid on-call firefighters with combination departments still volunteer or are unpaid for part or all of the time they spend on training, administrative tasks, equipment maintenance, public education, and fundraising and often cover the cost of supplemental training from their own pockets.


Volunteer firefighters carry radios or fire pagers, primarily the Motorola Minitor, to receive dispatch information where ever they are at the time a call is dispatched. Some combination departments use Nextel cell phones as well as alpha pagers with priority service contracts to dispatch information to volunteer firefighters. Depending on the response structure of the combination department, the volunteer may respond to the station to pick up an apparatus, or go directly to the scene of an incident in their personal vehicle with a full-time firefighter bringing the needed apparatus and equipment to the incident. Some combination departments also use volunteer firefighters to cover unfilled shifts of the full-time firefighters. Most volunteer firefighters live or work in the community they respond to fire dispatches in, and most combination departments have a requirement for residency within the community or within a certain distance of the community, in which they serve. Depending on the department, volunteer firefighters may respond 24/7 to any dispatched incidents or be split into response shifts. Response to incidents may be required during shifts, or a periodic run percentage may be required to maintain active status on a combination or volunteer department.


Sometimes departments have  auxiliary volunteers, who will usually handle some administrative functions and fund raising operations.


Junior firefighters are youths, typically in high school, sometimes junior high school, that learn about local fire and emergency services. They can receive medical training and fire training. Many programs allow them to respond alongside firefighters to incidents and allow them to serve usually as exterior firefighters, and assisting in emergency medical services that they are trained and qualified for. On a combination department, they can provide a basis from which volunteers are recruited from and provide additional manpower under certain circumstances.


Volunteer firefighters often outnumber career firefighters in a combination fire departments. This makes for a very complicated work environment, as full-time fire personnel typically are unionized employees under contract and volunteers rarely are. Friction is often caused in this environment as the career staff is typically at a station more than the volunteers. This causes the career staff to try and change station SOP's, apparatus equipment locations, furniture placement etc., the volunteers will not always agree.


Another source of friction is often the fact that career staff is in another chain of command. The volunteers cannot be reprimanded by career staff and vice versa. The career staff meets a certain minimum training level and typically completing an academy while volunteers typically have lower minimum requirements. However, in many case, volunteers have been in a department longer than the career staff, but are less trained.


Other issues can stem from inequities or resentment caused by bargained for benefits career firefighters receive under contract including training wages, shorter gear rotations, clothing allowances, and overtime pay. Sometimes starting volunteer firefighters are perceived as using their volunteer positions as stepping stones to full-time career positions.

15902929,Liberian Americans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberian_Americans,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberian_Americans&action=info,"Liberian Americans are an ethnic group of  Americans of full or partial Liberian ancestry. This can include Liberians who are descendants of Americo-Liberian people in America. The first wave of Liberians to the United States, after the slavery period, was after of the First Liberian Civil War in the 1990s and, then, after the Second Liberian Civil War in the early 2000s. An estimated 100,000 Liberians live in the U.S. as of this time. The diplomatic relationship between Liberia and the USA goes back over 150 years to Liberia's foundation by returning African slaves freed by abolitionist societies which set aside land for the freedmen and paved the way to its independence.


The first people that emigrated to the United States from the regions that currently form Liberia were slaves imported between the 17th and 19th centuries. Thus, many individuals can trace backgrounds to groups such as the Kpelle, Kru, Gola, and, perhaps, the Gio,  Grebo, Bassa, Vai  and Mandingo. Many of them were imported by Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia planters.  The children of some of these slaves gained some notability in the United States, as was the case of  abolitionist, journalist, physician, and writer Martin Delany (1812 â 1885), arguably the first proponent of American black nationalism and  the first African-American field officer in the United States Army during the American Civil War.


Between 1822 and the second half of the 19th century, especially with the abolition of slavery in the United States in the 1860s, many slaves returned to Africa, settling in West Africa and founding Liberia (inhabiting regions already populated). Liberian migration to the United States did not resume again until the first half of the 20th century when the first Liberians went to the United States. However, only several hundred of Liberians immigrated to the United States, a very small number compared with the people who emigrated from Europe, Asia and Latin America. In the 1950s and 1960s only a few hundred Liberian migrated to the United States (232 and 569 respectively). It was not until the 1970s when there was a considerable immigration from Liberia, which amounted to 2081 people. This low immigration was due to the fact that Liberia was one of the most stable democracies and prosperous economies in Africa up until the military coup in 1980.


During the 20th century few Liberian emigrated to United States; most who did were students. However, during the First Liberian Civil War (1989â96), thousands of Liberians emigrated to the United States. From 1990 through 1997, the INS reported that 13,458 Liberians fled to the United States and lived there permanently. During these years, there were also tens of thousands who sought temporary refuge in the United States. In 1991 alone, the INS guaranteed Temporary Protective Status (TPS) to approximately 9,000 Liberians in the United States.
After the war, another 6,000 Liberians moved to Providence, Rhode Island. About 10,000 other Liberians settled across the U.S. and most of them decided to stay after the war ended. Although the INS revoked the TPS status in 1997 following national elections in Liberia, many of these Liberian Americans refused return to Liberia. In 1999, the U.S. Congress decided to give the Liberian refugees permanent status in the United States.


After the Second Liberian Civil War (1999-2003), large numbers of Liberians settled in Rhode Island, Staten Island, Philadelphia, Virginia, Georgia and Minnesota. By 2010, Liberians established another sizable community in California primarily in West Los Angeles and San Francisco-Oakland.


Liberian American organizations estimate there are between 250,000 and 500,000 Liberians living in the United States. This figure includes Liberian residents  that have a temporary status, and American of Liberian descent.


Cities with large Liberian populations include Brooklyn Park, MN, Minneapolis, MN, St. Paul, MN, Brooklyn Center, MN Providence, RI, Pawtucket, RI, Staten Island, NY,  the Bronx, NY. Newark, NJ Trenton, NJ, ,  Morrisville, PA, Southwest Philadelphia, Darby, PA, Upper Darby, PA, Folcroft, PA, Sharon Hill, PA, Baltimore, MD, Silver Spring, MD, Gaithersburg, MD, Johnson City, TN, Charlotte, NC, Lawrenceville, GA, Jacksonville, FL, Fargo, ND, Des Moines, IA, Sioux Falls, SD, Columbus, OH, Fort Worth, TX, Phoenix, AZ


Many Liberians have formed families in United States.  However, some still vow to return to their country once the political and social situation stabilizes,  which, according to the president of the Union of Liberian Associations in the Americas, Joseph D. Z. Korto, seems unlikely to happen in a ""near future.""


While there is a variety of languages spoken in Liberia (where English is the official language of the country), the majority of Liberians in the United States speak Standard English as well as the Liberian Kreyol language also known as Kolokwa which serves as a lingua franca among Liberians of different ethnic groups. The Kru languages such as Bassa, Kru (of the same name) and Krahn are the most widely spoken Liberian native dialects in the United States as well as Kpelle and Mandingo, both Mande languages. Another language spoken by some Liberian Americans is Gullah, a Creole language, though this language is spoken primarily by the descendants of slaves brought from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, and not by recent immigrants.  It is spoken by a small group of people in the Carolina Sea Islands and the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States.


85.6% of Liberians are Christians. Protestantism at  76.3% is predominant in the Greater Monrovia region and surrounding suburbs and Catholicism at 7.2% is predominant in the Southeastern counties. Islam is practiced by 12.2% of Liberians and is predominant among the Mandingo ethnic group as well as many members of the Vai and Mende ethnic groups. Traditional beliefs such as Voodoo or Juju have a stronghold in the more rural counties but is still practiced even among Christians and Muslims. The religious statistics for Liberian Americans however tend to be more Christian or irreligious.


Liberian Americans are actively involved in lobbying the federal government,  supporting freedom and democracy in Liberia. They also have organizations that support various issues affecting Liberia, such as humanitarian assistance, wildlife and nature preservation, and women's rights.


Stanton Witherspoon, owner and founder of Spoon Network in Liberia. The network comprises radio and TV stations. As host of Spoon Talk, a very high profile and popular syndicated internet and radio program, along with his philanthropic work as head of the Spoon Foundation, Mr. Witherspoon has gained a spot amongst the most popular Liberian-born personalities abroad. Witherspoon currently resides in New Jersey, USA.

It was classified as 'threatened' under the U.S. Endangered Species Act from 1992-2016. The validity of this subspecies has been repeatedly debated.


The subspecies does not have a substantially different appearance than the nominate U. americanus americanus, but the skull is relatively long, narrow and flat and the molars are proportionately large. The fur color is usually black, but a cinnamon phase is known to exist.


The Louisiana black bear historically occurred in Louisiana, Mississippi, East Texas and Arkansas.


Four areas are currently known to have populations of the black bear:


The Louisiana black bear can travel for long distances and has been sighted in many areas of Louisiana not normally considered bear habitat. Occurrences are reported from East Texas and subpopulations have expanded into Mississippi. Black bears have been sighted in Kisatchie National Forest, Allen Parish, Natchitoches Parish, East Baton Rouge, and Bossier City.


While the IUCN classifies the conservation situation of the black bear as a species as Least Concern, the Louisiana black bear as a subspecies was listed as 'threatened' under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1992. Under this ruling, all bears within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear, from eastern Texas to southern Mississippi, have been protected. On April 11, 2016, the Louisiana black bear was removed from the list as well as the Similarity-of-Appearance Protections for the American black bear.


Loss of habitat was the primary reason the bear was placed on the federal endangered species list. Programs and initiatives have resulted in the conservation and restoration of over 600,000 acres (240,000Â ha) of forestland in the Mississippi River floodplain of Louisiana. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have acquired land for Wildlife Management Areas and National Wildlife Refuges.

It is a pivot joint.


The atlanto-axial joint is a joint between the atlas bone and the axis bone, which are the first and second cervical vertebrae. It is a pivot joint. It is of a complicated nature.


There is a pivot articulation between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the anterior arch and the transverse ligament of the atlas.


There are three atlanto-axial joints: one median and two lateral:


The ligaments connecting these bones are:


The atlantoaxial articular capsules are thick and loose, and connect the margins of the lateral masses of the atlas with those of the posterior articular surfaces of the axis.


Each is strengthened at its posterior and medial part by an accessory ligament, which is attached below to the body of the axis near the base of the odontoid process, and above to the lateral mass of the atlas near the transverse ligament.


Because of its proximity to the brain stem and importance in stabilization, fracture or injury to the atlanto-axial joint can cause serious problems. Common trauma and pathologies include (but are not limited to):


The dens: significant depression on the skull can push the dens into the brainstem, causing death. The dens itself is vulnerable to fracture due to trauma or ossification.


Transverse ligament: Should the transverse ligament of the atlas fail due to trauma or disease, the dens is no longer anchored and can travel up the cervical spine, causing paralysis. If it reaches the medulla death can result. 
Alar ligaments: stress or trauma can stretch the weaker alar ligaments, causing an increase in range of motion of approximately 30%.


Posterior atlanto-occipital membrane: genetic traits can sometimes result in ossification, turning the groove into a foramen.


Osteoarthritis may occur at the atlanto-axial joint. This involves classic pathophysiology, such as loss of articular cartilage, osteophytes visible with radiography, and bone thickening with a narrow joint space. Conservative management is usually effective, involving analgesics. Surgery may be used in severe cases, and may have good outcomes.


A widening of the atlanto-axial joint, as measured between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of atlas and the front of the odontoid process, indicates an injury to the transverse atlantal ligament. Normally, this atlanto-dental distance is less than 2 mm, sometimes a maximum of 3 mm is accepted in men and 2.5 mm in women.",14,6 May 2006, 17 September 2021,75,1,1

651913,Co-curricular activity (Singapore),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-curricular_activity_(Singapore),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Co-curricular_activity_(Singapore)&action=info,"In Singapore, a co-curricular activity (CCA), previously known as an extracurricular activity (ECA), is a non-academic activity that all students, regardless of nationality, must participate in. Co-curricular activities are responsible for the holistic growth of the child. It allows for character development, learning of values and social emotional competencies for the student's future. The interaction among students through CCA also allows for the development of friendships and a higher sense of belonging to the school and community. This policy was introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE).


CCA choices vary widely from school to school, although schools at each education level are required to conform to national standards prescribed for that level. Co-curricular activities includes all those activities which needs mind, heart and hand coordination. Such activities include indoor or outdoor games, solving puzzles, collages, drawing, dancing, singing, mimicry, knitting, cooking and so on. The range of CCA choices available increases at each education level.


CCA is strongly encouraged in the primary and post-secondary education level. It is however compulsory in secondary education level.


In secondary schools, CCAs are treated more seriously. Students are required to pick at least one Core CCA to join at Secondary One. Belonging to a Core CCA is compulsory, and the students may choose a second CCA if they wish. If the student excels and achieves results in their CCA, 1 to 2 'O' Level points are removed from the examination aggregate (a lower aggregate indicates better marks) at the end of the fourth/fifth year. Although the marks are few, it is believed by many that they may make a difference when the students are considered for the most popular post-secondary educational institutions. For example, one minimum prerequisite for admission to the Raffles Institution at Year Five, via the 'O' Levels, is an already perfect score with the maximum of 4 points removed.


The activities available as CCA choices can be divided into 4 key categories:


CCAs are held outside of curriculum hours and the activities partaken depend on the nature of the particular CCA. For example, uniformed groups do foot drills and team-building exercises.


Many alumni return to their alma mater after graduation to help impart what they have learned to their juniors. Some do so within a formal framework, such within the uniformed groups (where ex-cadets are appointed as cadet officers) or as part of the Voluntary Adult Leader scheme (for those above age 20). Others do so on a casual basis.


Many CCA-related competitions are held in Singapore, creating a competitive environment which provide CCA groups an objective to work towards.


The Ministry of Education organises competitions for competitive sports at the zonal and national level, respectively the yearly Zonal and National Schools Competitions. MOE also organises the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) for the Aesthetics CCAs.


Note that Band may either count as a uniformed group or a performing arts group.


In some schools, instead of separate clubs for Language, Debate and Drama (and even Culture), these domains are grouped under the heading of Language Debate and Drama Societies, an example of which is the English Literary Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS).",5,13 May 2004, 19 May 2021,409,0,0
3237968,Prince of Foxes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Foxes,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prince_of_Foxes&action=info,"Prince of Foxes is a 1947 historical novel by Samuel Shellabarger, following the adventures of the fictional Andrea Orsini, a captain in the service of Cesare Borgia during his conquest of the Romagna.


Andrea Zoppo, an Italian peasant schooled in the arts and versed in the ways of nobility during his University years, loses his old identity during the French invasion of Florence, and becomes Andrea Orsini, a bastard member of a dead Neapolitan junior branch of the great house of Orsini. Having made his name with the French forces, he takes service with Cesare Borgia, with dreams of uniting Italy to stop the depredations of foreign adventurers and the manipulations of France and the Holy Roman Empire. However, his love of Lady Camilla of the Bagliones and respect for her husband Lord Varano of Citta del Monte derail those plans when he is sent to their court to take the city by treachery.


The novel begins with Andrea on the verge of embarking from Venice on his first non-military mission for Borgia, to induce Alfonso d'Este, the heir of Ferrara, the ""brightest court in Italy,"" to marry Lucrezia Borgia, lately widowed, despite the numerous objections against the match on the grounds of state and taste. Orsini meets with an instrument maker and humanist to sell a certain painting he claims was taken during the fall of one of the cities of the Romagne. There he meets Camilla Varano, the wife of the lord of the fictional Citta del Monte, both of which have been promised to him by Borgia. There is a definite attraction between the two.


The d'Estes, forced by Borgia to accept Andrea's service, do not wish to kill him in their demesne, and delegate the matter to their ambassador to Venice. He uses Mario Belli (Marius de Bella, lately of Savoy), erstwhile nobleman, traitor, and assassin of some repute. Mario fails, but, a true ""modern,"" turns his coat and offers information. Finding him intriguing and useful, Orsini spares him and offers him a place in his retinue. By force of his personality, Orsini overawes the d'Este ambassador and makes his way to Ferrara. On the journey, Belli secretly discovers Andrea's true heritage.


In Ferrara, despite the interference of Duke Ercole d'Este and his impetuous son Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, and the resistance of the cannon-happy Alfonso d'Este, he accomplishes his mission, securing Alfonso's promises. Meanwhile, Orsini makes an enemy of the cardinal, befriends Belli's enemy Pierre de Bayard, paints a monastery, and falls deeper in love with Camilla, a guest of the d'Estes.


Without knowledge of Andrea's success, the duke and cardinal send him to bring to Ferrara a living saint, Lucia Brocadelli of Narni, a woman whose stigmata are the talk of the region. Despite the Duke's earnest inducements and her willingness to go, the people of Viterbo will not release her. After a pleasant sojourn at the Citta del Monte, Orsini meets the saint, whose obvious piety deeply affects both him and Belli. In making his attempt to free her, Andrea is captured, but Belli succeeds, and Andrea talks his way out of the fracas.


In Rome, the pope grants his niece, Angela, lady in waiting to Lucrezia, a betrothal to her former lover, Orsini, and reveals his plot against the Varanos, who will come to Rome for the Jubilee. Cesare, thinking his father's actions precipitous, arrives in Rome to stop the arrest and the betrothal. Orsini attempts to detach himself from the favor of his former lover, and has himself knifed for his trouble. Belli, distrusting the sovereigns and potions of the medicos and dottores, tends to the wound himself. With his contacts in the underworld, Belli interrupts Angela's attempt to assassinate her rival for Andrea's affection, and, in an unnerving interview with Cesare, he secures Camilla's safety.


Borgia's conquest of the Marches had proceeded smoothly up to this point: his father, Pope Alexander VI, declared all his vicars in the region deposed and the citizens, largely seeing these rulers as cruel and petty, viewed Cesare Borgia as a great improvement when he eventually took power. In this way, Giovanni Sforza, first husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia, was soon ousted from Pesaro; Pandolfo Malatesta lost Rimini and Faenza surrendered. But Borgia can only gain Citta del Monte through treachery, as low taxes and the love Varano's people bear him leave no obvious angles to stir up unrest, and Borgia cannot afford protracted warfare in the Marches. With Ferrara in alliance, he recalls his spy in Varano's court so that Orsini may take his place as captain of the guard, to suborn its people and assassinate its prince.


At Citta del Monte, Orsini falls further from Cesare's orbit, taking Varano as his new role model. Varano is a man of noble character and vast military experience, having in his youth made his fortune as a captain in the mercenary army of the prince of Urbino, serving the Papal interest. This wealth has allowed him to adorn his court without oppressing his domain. With a new understanding of leadership and foregoing his dreams of an Italy united under a single personality, Orsini sets about to strengthen Citta del Monte against Cesare. When the ultimatum finally arrives, Varano asks his people whether he should stay and bring his city the miseries of protracted siege, or take himself into exile. They overwhelmingly reject Borgia and acclaim him. The Varanos also reject Borgia's claim that Orsini is the impostor Zoppo, embarrassing him. Belli, according to their contract, informs Orsini that he will leave his service for Borgia's.


Despite a spirited defense of several months, Citta del Monte is left battered and bereft of its lord Varano, who dies of wounds incurred in the first attack. The walls breached beyond repair, the city prepares itself for its last defense, when Borgia, impatient, offers terms through his lieutenants. The terms are generous for a people so stubbornly set against him, but for one point: Zoppo must surrender himself. Despite Camilla's rejection of the terms, Orsini gives himself up in order to save her and the city.


Borgia keeps his terms, stripping the valuables from the court, but leaving the city under Camilla and one of his Catalan adventurers. However, to embarrass the young widow, he parades Orsini before her after having starved him for weeks, proves his Zoppo identity by means of his peasant mother, and plans his execution. Belli, now a favored lieutenant of Borgia, is outraged: after all the losses Orsini has inflicted on Borgia, is mere execution to suffice? He offers to gouge out his former master's eyes before Camilla, Borgia, and the assembled captains, and, given leave, does so.


Borgia, feigning pity, sends the blind peasant and his mother to wander the countryside, but sends Belli after them to ""hurry them along."" Belli catches up to them, whereupon Orsini reveals the trick to his mother: Belli simulated the gouging using grape innards and blood from his hands. They plot to recover Citta del Monte. Belli returns to Camilla for funding, warning her that Borgia has granted the new city prefect the chance to win her through whatever means he deems necessary, including the torture of her townsfolk. She is to pretend madness to discourage these plans.


Despite their careful plans, Orsini is recognized by Angela Borgia and the Cardinal d'Este while recruiting Swiss mercenaries and Pierre de Bayard. They reveal the plot to Borgia's captain, and spying on Orsini's interview with Camilla in the madhouse, discover how to stop the plot. Having suspected them, Orsini reveals that they have actually set the attack in motion. Bayard and the Swiss gain the walls as the city rises in revolt. Camilla gives the Catalan prefect to the people to avenge themselves upon, and Angela and d'Este are sent away.


Months later, the pope is dead and Cesare, ill and left without patronage, has been captured and exiled by his enemies. Orsini is acclaimed by all as the model man of the Renaissance, married to Camilla, whose (anonymous) paintings excite the envy of Mantegna himself.",0,25 November 2005, 20 May 2020,57,0,0

It was the second and last for East West Records, a now defunct sub-label of Warner Bros. Records.


It saw the return of ""Uncle Punchy"" Lawrence Packer to the production of the album and a return to Uncle Punchy Studios in Silver Spring, Maryland. It is the band's best-selling album in the US, at over 200,000 copies, to date. The album gets regular live coverage still, with at least half the track list making their live performances on a regular basis, well over 20 years later.


This album captures the band's MO of trying out new styles and genres, with a definable mix of funk metal in the songs this time around. The album is considered to be the point where the band had begun to evolve their stoner and blues rock know-how. The record also keeps with their punk metal credentials, containing some heavier tracks. The album is considered a staple of the 1990s stoner rock genre. The album features some of their more 'spacey' pieces such as ""Big News"", ""Escape from the Prison Planet"", ""I Have the Body of John Wilkes Booth"", and ""Spacegrass"".


All music and lyrics written by Clutch.


The Japanese release of the album contains an extra track, ""Apache"", which was initially released on the radio only promotional EP 'Big News', along with a demo version of ""Spacegrass"", which has never been reissued to date. It would appear on the bootleg 'Clutch: Rarities and B-Side' some years later.

Inside the peridium, the gleba consists of spherical, warted spores, and a capillitium of simple or branched hyphal threads that have spiral or angular thickenings. The genus is named after Italian priest and naturalist Giovanni Antonio Battarra.

This was the 20th appearance of the event, one of four events to be held at every Summer Games since canoeing was introduced in 1936.


The reigning World Champions are Liu Hao and Wang Hao of China. The reigning Olympic champions are Sebastian Brendel and Jan Vandrey of Germany; Brendel will return, this time paired with Tim Hecker.

Qualifying places were awarded to the NOC, not to the individual canoeist who earned the place.


Isaquias Queiroz of Brazil qualified in both the C-2 and the C-1, resulting in an additional quota place added to the C-2 with the Czech Republic adding that quota place to its C-1 spot to qualify in the C-2. This brought the total number of boats in the event to 14. The Americas continental tournament was cancelled; that place was allocated through the World Championships, with the place going to Canada. The Oceania place was also reallocated, with Europe receiving a second place.


Sprint canoeing uses a four-round format for events with at least 11 boats, with heats, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. For a 14-boat event, the rounds are as follows:


The course is a flatwater course 9 metres wide. The name of the event describes the particular format within sprint canoeing. The ""C"" format means a canoe, with the canoeist kneeling and using a single-bladed paddle to paddle and steer (as opposed to a kayak, with a seated canoeist, double-bladed paddle, and foot-operated rudder). The ""2"" is the number of canoeists in each boat. The ""1000 metres"" is the distance of each race.


The event was held over two consecutive days, with two rounds per day. All sessions started at 9:30 a.m. local time, though there are multiple events with races in each session.

It is one of the 500 public school districts of Pennsylvania.


According to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, 27.9% of the districtâs pupils lived at 185% or below the Federal Poverty Level as shown by their eligibility for federal free or reduced price school meal programs in 2012. In 2013 the Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that 15 students in the Blackhawk School District were homeless.

By 2013, the median household income in the United States rose to $52,100. In 2014, the median household income in the US was $53,700.


According to district officials, in the 2007-08 school year, Blackhawk School District provided basic educational services to 2,688 pupils through the employment of 187 teachers, 76 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 9 administrators.

Blackhawk School District operates Blackhawk High School (grades 9-12), Highland Middle School (6-8), Blackhawk Intermediate School (3-5), Northwestern Primary School (K-2) and Patterson Primary School (K-2). The district also offers a free, taxpayer-funded preschool for four-year-olds at the Intermediate School. High school students may choose to attend Beaver County Career and Technology Career for training in the construction and mechanical trades. The Beaver Valley Intermediate Unit IU27 provides the district with a wide variety of services like specialized education for disabled students and hearing, speech and visual disability services and professional development for staff and faculty.


Blackhawk School District is governed by nine individually elected board members, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The federal government controls the programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act (renamed the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015), which mandates that the district focus its resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The school board is required by state law to post a financial report on the district on its website by March of each school year.


The district is divided into three regions for school board electoral purposes. There are three school board seats in each region. School board members serve four-year terms with no compensation. There are no term limits. Some public meetings are posted online in videos. Board minutes were available online in 2016.


The Superintendent and Business Manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials is voting members of the board. The Blackhawk School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. These contracts must be in writing and are subject to public disclosure under the state's Right to Know Act. Pursuant to Act 141 of 2012 which amended the Pennsylvania School Code, all school districts that have hired superintendents on/after the fall of 2012 are required to develop objective performance standards and post them on the district's website. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent regarding the renewal of the employment contract.


The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a ""D"" for transparency based on a review of ""what information can people find on their school district's website"". It examined the school district's website for information regarding taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more.


Blackhawk School District was ranked 169th out of 493 Pennsylvania school districts by the Pittsburgh Business Times in 2015. The ranking is based on the previous three years of student academic achievement as demonstrated by PSSA results in reading, writing, math and science, and the three Keystone Exams (literature, Algebra 1, Biology I) in high school. Three school districts were excluded because they do not operate high schools (Saint Clair Area School District, Midland Borough School District, and Duquesne City School District). The PSSAs are given to all children in the 3rd through 8th grades. Adapted PSSA examinations are given to children in  special education programs. Writing exams are given to children in the 5th and 8th grades.





In 2014, the Pittsburgh Business Times also reported an Overachievers Ranking for 105 local western Pennsylvania school districts. Blackhawk School District ranked 91st out of 105. The editor stated: ""a ranking answers the question â which school districts do better than expectations based upon economics? This rank takes the Honor Roll rank and adds the percentage of students in the district eligible for free and reduced-price lunch into the formula. A district finishing high on this rank is smashing expectations, and any district above the median point is exceeding expectations.""


In 2009, the academic achievement of the students of Blackhawk School District was in the 86th percentile among 500 Pennsylvania school districts (0-99; 100 is state best).


In 2010, 2011 and 2012, Blackhawk School District achieved ""Adequate Yearly Progress"" (AYP) status each school year.

From 2004 to 2009, the district achieved AYP status each school year. In 2003, the school was in ""Warning"" AYP status due to lagging student achievement.

Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs, are No Child Left Behind Act-related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012 in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics by the spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's academic standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and environmental studies. The mathematics exam included algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.


In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, reading/literature and Biology 1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year.

According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 25% of the Blackhawk High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.


Blackhawk High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses at local higher education institutions to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $3,412 for the program.

The Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a research arm of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, compared the SAT data of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania to students in urban areas. From 2003 to 2005, the average total SAT score for students in rural Pennsylvania was 992, while urban students averaged 1,006. During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test-takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvaniaâs SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC.


The Blackhawk School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 24.0 credits to graduate, including mathematics 4 credits, English 4 credits, social studies 4 credits, science 3 credits, including 3 courses and 1 credit of Biology, Physical Education 2 credits, Health 0.5 credit, STEAM elective 1.0 credit, Arts/Humanities 2 credits and electives 3.5. A student must earn a minimum of 5.5 credits to obtain sophomore standing.  Music academy students take other classes, are not required to earn the four math credits, and take fewer gym credits.


By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Blackhawk High School students have one of three options: Comprehensive Career Development Plan, Community Service Project and In-depth Academic Research Project. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.


By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2019, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade.


Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, a civics and government exam will be added.


In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP.


In 2013, Blackhawk High School offered 15 Advanced Placement (AP) courses, at a higher cost than regular courses. The student pays the fee for the exam, which was $89 per test per pupil in 2012. Students have the option of taking College Board-approved courses and then taking the board's examination in the spring. Students who achieve a 3 or better on the exam may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Blackhawk High School 66% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.


In 2015, Blackhawk reported offering 16 Advance Placement courses. 68 percent of students who took an AP course at Blackhawk achieved a 3 or better on the AP exam given by the College Board, thereby earning potential college credits.


The Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that 71 percent of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania chose to continue their education after high school in 2003, compared with 79 percent of urban high school graduates.


The eight grade was moved from the high school to the middle school in 2013. Eighth graders are tested in reading, writing, mathematics and science. Beginning in the spring of 2013, eighth graders who are enrolled in Algebra I take the Keystone Exam for Algebra I at the end of the course. The testing of 8th grade in reading and mathematics began in 1999 as a state initiative. Testing in science began in 2007.

In December 2013, the district administration reported that 267 pupils, or 10% of district pupils, received special education services, with 44% of the identified students having a specific learning disability.


In December 2012, Blackhawk School District administration reported that 257 pupils, or 10.3% of district pupils, received special education services. Of the identified pupils, 42.4% had a specific learning disability. In December 2010, Blackhawk School District Administration reported that 264 pupils, or 10% of district pupils, received special education services. Of the identified pupils, 41% had a specific learning disability. In December 2009, Blackhawk School District Administration reported that 271 pupils, or 10.5% of district pupils, received special education services.


In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted that the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. The school district has provided full-day kindergarten since 2011. The district has seen a slight increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings.


In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs.  At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These include review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website, regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them.


Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA. Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students.


In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per-pupil funding, as well as all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania special education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of these students.


Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of their students receiving special education services, while others have 10%. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of these students.


In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.


Blackhawk School District received a $1,496,931 supplement from the state for special education services in 2010. For the 2011â2012, 2012â2013 and 2013â2014 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they had received in 2010-11. This level of funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services, and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014â2015 school year, Blackhawk School District received an increase to $1,515,207 from the Commonwealth for special education funding. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding.


In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion, or 30%, and the federal government providing 10% of the funding.


Blackhawk School District Administration reported that 67, or 2.46%, of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, Blackhawk School District must provide programs for mentally gifted students at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.


In September 2013, Blackhawk School Board approved by a 7-2 vote a new employment contract with the teachers' union. Four board members left the board in December 2013. In February 2014, the new Blackhawk School Board voted 6-2 to revoke the collective bargaining agreement questioning the legality of the agreement. The superintendent reported to the board that she would be forced to lay off teachers due to the high costs of the new contract. Pennsylvania state law allows districts to lay off professional staff in three circumstances: a reduction in enrollment, a program being curtailed or eliminated, or schools being consolidated or reorganized. The Blackhawk Teachers' Union filed an unfair labor complaint with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board. The Pennsylvania Labor Board examiner ruled that the contract was legal.


In 2013, the average teacher salary in Blackhawk School District was $58,027 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $26,237 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $84,265. The district employed 195 teachers and administrators with a top salary of $119,000. Blackhawk School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x final average salary x total credited service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final three years of employment.


In 2011, the average teacher salary in Blackhawk School District was $59,354 a year. The district employed 194 teachers and administrator with a top salary of $100,296.


According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Blackhawk School District receives 46.3% of its annual revenue from the state.


For the 2015-16 school year, Governor Tom Wolf released partial Basic Education Funding of $4,347,656 to Blackhawk School District in January 2016. This was part of $10.3 billion in school funding withheld from the public schools by the governor since the summer of 2015. The disbursement did not follow the new Basic Education Fair Funding formula which had been established by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in June 2015. Ten Pennsylvania school districts received no increase in Basic Education Funding under Governor Wolf's proposal. In compliance with a legislative mandate that was passed with veto proof majorities in the PA House and Senate, the final BEF funding was set for 2015-16. Blackhawk School District received $9,073,461 in Basic Education funds for the 2015-16 school year. This was a 1.53% increase, yielding a $136,579 increase over the previous school year's funding. The district also received $359,398 in ""Ready to Learn"" funding from the state.


The Pennsylvania education budget for 2015-16 was $5.93 billion for Basic Education, a $200 million or a 3.5 percent increase over the 2014-15 allocation. Another $1.08 billion was allotted for special education funding, a $30 million or 2.9 percent increase over 2014-15. Additionally, the state paid over $500 million towards school employee social security payments and over $1 billion to the teachers' pension fund (PSERS).


For the 2014-2015 school year, Blackhawk School District received $8,936,909 in state Basic Education Funding. The district also received $280,552 in a new Ready to Learn block grant. The state's enacted Education Budget included $5,526,129,000 for the 2014â2015 Basic Education Funding. The education budget also included Accountability Block funding at $100 million and $241 million in new Ready to Learn funding for public schools that focus on student achievement and academic success. The state paid another $500.8 million to Social Security on the school employees' behalf and another $1.16 billion to the state teachers' pension system (PSERS). In total, Pennsylvania's education budget for K-12 public schools was $10 billion. This was a $305 million increase over 2013-14 state spending and the greatest amount ever allotted by the Commonwealth for its public schools.


In the 2013-2014 school year, the Blackhawk School District received a 1.7% increase, or $8,936,909 in Pennsylvania Basic Education Funding (BEF). This is $148,572 more than its 2012-13 state BEF to the district. Additionally, Blackhawk School District received $135,477 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement and level funding for special education services. Among the public school districts in Beaver County, Midland Borough School District received the highest percentage increase in BEF at 10.2%. The district has the option of applying for several other state and federal grants to increase revenues. The Commonwealth's budget increased Basic Education Funding statewide by $123 million to over $5.5 billion. Most of Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts received an increase of Basic Education Funding in a range of 0.9% to 4%. Eight public school districts received exceptionally high funding increases of 10% to 16%. The highest increase in state funding was awarded to Austin Area School District, which received a 22.5% increase in Basic Education Funding. The highest percent of state spending per student is in the Chester-Upland district, where roughly 78 percent comes from state coffers. In Philadelphia, it is nearly 49 percent. As part of the education budget, the state provided the PSERS (Pennsylvania school employee pension fund) with $1,017,000,000 and Social Security payments for school employees of $495 million.


For the 2012â2013 school year, Blackhawk School District received $8,780,604. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012â2013 included $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in Basic Education Funding, which was an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. In addition, the Commonwealth provided $100 million for the Accountability Block Grant (ABG) program. Blackhawk School District received $135,477 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The state also provided a $544.4 million payment for school employees' Social Security and $856 million for a school employees' retirement fund called PSERS. This amount was a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011â2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, school employees' Social Security, pupil transportation, and nonpublic and charter school pupil transportation. Since taking office, Corbettâs first two budgets had restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010-11 school year.


In the 2011â2012 school year, Blackhawk School District received a $8,780,604 allocation of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the Blackhawk School District received $135,478 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011â2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount was a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010â2011. The highest increase in state Basic Education Funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, Blackhawk School District reported that 556 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.


In the 2010â2011 school budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $9,149,269. Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Midland Borough School District, which got a 7.57% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County, which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of  Governor Rendellâs policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.


In the 2009â2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.16% increase in Basic Education Funding, for a total of $8,969,872, to Blackhawk School District. Among the public school districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Big Beaver Falls Area School District, which got a 5.26% increase.  Ninety Pennsylvania public school districts received a 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as part of the state budget proposal.


The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $4,787,151.79.


All Pennsylvania school districts also receive additional funding from the state through several other funding allocations, including reimbursement of charter school expenditures, special education funding, secondary career and technical education subsidies, and PA Accountability Grants. Low-achieving schools were eligible for educational assistance program funding. All Pennsylvania school districts also receive federal dollars for various programs, including special education funding and Title I funding for children from low income families. In 2010, Pennsylvania spent over $24 billion for public education â local, state and federal dollars combined.


Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These include teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size in K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, and before- or after-school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $367,720 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide intensive instruction for struggling students during the school day, to extend the school year, to provide after-school tutoring, and for high school reform.


The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funds to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, science, history, and math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers' use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Blackhawk School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07 or in 2007-08. The district received $113,840 in 2008-09. In Beaver County, the highest award was given to Freedom Area School District, which received $476,723. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis.


Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the state funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs.


Blackhawk School District received $180,532 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, special education funding, Accountability Block Grant funding, PreK Counts funding, transportation funding, and reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees, as well as other state grants which the district must apply to receive.


Blackhawk School District did not participate in Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PreK Counts state preschool grants in years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015; PA Science It's Elementary grants (discontinued effective with the 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell); Education Assistance Grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants (discontinued effective with 2011-12 budget); or federal 21st Century Learning grants.


Blackhawk School District received an extra $2,862,640 in ARRA â Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009â10 and 2010â2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.


Blackhawk School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant, which would have provided hundreds of thousands in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.


The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with ""Highly Quality"" teachers and principals, as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000.


Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for Title II funds. In 2012-13, Blackhawk School District received $79,514 in federal Title II funding. In 2014-15, Blackhawk School District applied for and received $74,553.


The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school, a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at the pupils' homes. This data is collected and submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, which in turn notifies the federal government.


In 2012-13, Blackhawk School District received $1,358 in Title III funding for English language learners. For 2014-15, Blackhawk School District received $855 in Title III funding.


The Blackhawk School Board elected to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.


Property tax rates in 2015-16 were set by the Blackhawk School Board at 59.1200 mills in Beaver County and 18.5000 mills in Lawrence County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth, as they create a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania apply only to real estate â land and buildings â and is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions, and government property. Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.


Unlike in other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. Landowners in Blackhawk School District are the target of a proposed major pipeline. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, thereby limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Blackhawk School District is adversely impacted this way by major transmission pipeline development.


In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Backhawk School District was $173 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,977 property owners applied for tax relief. In 2010, the relief was $171. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office.  Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres (40,000Â m2) and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 64% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Among Beaver County public school districts, the highest amount of property tax relief goes to property owners in Big Beaver Falls Area School District, who received $352 in 2010. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County, who received $632 per approved homestead. Residents of Chester Upland School District have been the top recipients each year since the program began.


The Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Blackhawk School District residents aged 65 and older, widows and widowers aged 50 and older, and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half  of their Social Security income; consequently, an individual with income of much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.


The school district was featured in the landmark court case Morrow v. Balaski, 719 F. 3d 160 (3d Cir. 2013), dealing with a school's  responsibility to prevent bullying. In the case, the Morrows daughter was subject to bullying by another student in the form of threats, assaults, and acts of intimidation. Unable to obtain help from school officials, the Morrows were ultimately compelled to remove their children from school. According to the court opinion, ""The Morrows subsequently met with school officials, but they responded by telling the Morrows that they could not guarantee Brittany and Emily's safety. Instead, rather than removing Anderson and her confederate from the school, school officials advised the Morrows to consider another school for their children. In October 2008, the Morrows enrolled their daughters in a different school.""  The case stands for the precedent-setting proposition that even if a school is aware of bullying and does little to prevent it or protect the victim, it cannot be held legally liable.


Blackhawk School District administration reported 23 incidents of bullying in 2012â2013. Additionally, there were two harassment incidents and no sexual harassment incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in no incidents at the schools.
 Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center, which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school.


The district administration reported zero incidents of bullying in 2010. There were 40 cases of harassment and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in no incidents at the schools.


Education standards relating to student safety and anti-harassment programs are described in 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.


Blackhawk School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports.


The Blackhawk High School Music Academy is a program open to students in grades 9 through 12 in Beaver County. The music program focuses on performance as well as music theory, technology and history. It provides voice and instrument instruction.


By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school, or home school, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.


According to the PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti-child abuse training once every three years.


Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid. The district is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. Article XVI-C of the Public School Code requires the disclosure of interscholastic athletic opportunities for all public secondary school entities in Pennsylvania. All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes, beginning with the 2012-13 school year, and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE.


According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training before coaching.

24913960,House of Commons of Great Britain,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain&action=info,"The House of Commons of Great Britain was the lower house of the Parliament of Great Britain between 1707 and 1801. In 1707, as a result of the Acts of Union of that year, it replaced the House of Commons of England and the third estate of the Parliament of Scotland, as one of the most significant changes brought about by the Union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain.


In the course of the 18th century, the office of Prime Minister developed. The notion that a government remains in power only as long as it retains the support of Parliament also evolved, leading to the first ever motion of no confidence, when Lord North's government failed to end the American Revolution. The modern notion that only the support of the House of Commons is necessary for a government to survive, however, was of later development. Similarly, the custom that the Prime Minister is always a Member of the Lower House, rather than the Upper one, did not evolve until the twentieth century.


The business of the house was controlled by an elected Speaker. The Speaker's official role was to moderate debate, make rulings on procedure, announce the results of votes, and the like. The Speaker decided who may speak and had the powers to discipline members who break the procedures of the house. The Speaker often also represented the body in person, as the voice of the body in ceremonial and some other situations. The title was first recorded in 1377 to describe the role of Thomas de Hungerford in the Parliament of England. By convention, Speakers are normally addressed in Parliament as Mister Speaker, if a man, or Madam Speaker, if a woman.


In 1801, the House was enlarged to become the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, as a result of the Act of Union of 1800 which combined Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.


The members of the last House of Commons of England had been elected between 7 May and 6 June 1705, and from 1707 they all continued to sit as members of the new House of Commons. The last general election in Scotland had been held in the autumn of 1702, and from 1707 only forty-five of the members of the Parliament of Scotland joined the new house. In Scotland there was also no new election from the burghs, and the places available were filled by co-option from the last Parliament.


The constituencies which elected members in England and Wales remained unchanged throughout the existence of the Parliament of Great Britain.

38932,Phillis Wheatley,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillis_Wheatley,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phillis_Wheatley&action=info,"Phillis Wheatley Peters, also spelled Phyllis and Wheatly (c. 1753 â December 5, 1784) was the first African-American author of a published book of poetry. Born in West Africa, she was sold into slavery at the age of seven or eight and transported to North America, where she was bought by the Wheatley family of Boston. After she learned to read and write, they encouraged her poetry when they saw her talent.


On a 1773 trip to London with her master's son, seeking publication of her work, Wheatley met prominent people who became patrons. The publication in London of her Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral on September 1, 1773, brought her fame both in England and the American colonies. Figures such as George Washington praised her work. A few years later, African-American poet Jupiter Hammon praised her work in a poem of his own.


Wheatley was emancipated by her masters shortly after the publication of her book. They soon died, and she married poor grocer John Peters, lost three children, and died in poverty and obscurity at the age of 31.


Although the date and place of her birth are not documented, scholars believe that Phillis Wheatley was born in 1753 in West Africa, most likely in present-day Gambia or Senegal. She was sold by a local chief to a visiting trader, who took her to Boston in the British Colony of Massachusetts, on July 11, 1761, on a slave ship called The Phillis. It was owned by Timothy Fitch and captained by Peter Gwinn.


On arrival in Boston, she was bought by the wealthy Boston merchant and tailor John Wheatley as a slave for his wife Susanna. John and Susanna Wheatley named her Phillis, after the ship that had transported her to America. She was given their last name of Wheatley, as was a common custom if any surname was used for enslaved people.


The Wheatleys' 18-year-old daughter, Mary, was Phillis's first tutor in reading and writing. Their son, Nathaniel, also helped her. John Wheatley was known as a progressive throughout New England; his family afforded Phillis an unprecedented education for an enslaved person, and one unusual for a woman of any race. By the age of 12, she was reading Greek and Latin classics in their original languages, as well as difficult passages from the Bible. At the age of 14, she wrote her first poem, ""To the University of Cambridge [Harvard], in New England"". Recognizing her literary ability, the Wheatley family supported Phillis's education and left household labor to their other domestic enslaved workers. The Wheatleys often showed off her abilities to friends and family. Strongly influenced by her readings of the works of Alexander Pope, John Milton, Homer, Horace, and Virgil, Phillis began to write poetry.


In 1773, at the age of 20, Phillis accompanied Nathaniel Wheatley to London in part for her health (she suffered from chronic asthma), but largely because Susanna believed Phillis would have a better chance of publishing her book of poems there. She had an audience with Frederick Bull, who was the Lord Mayor of London, and other significant members of British society. (An audience with King George III was arranged, but Phillis returned to Boston before it could take place.) Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, became interested in the talented young African woman and subsidized the publication of Wheatley's volume of poems, which appeared in London in the summer of 1773. As Hastings was ill, she and Phillis never met.[pageÂ needed]


After her book was published, by November 1773, the Wheatleys emancipated Phillis. Her former enslaver Susanna died in the spring of 1774, and John in 1778. Shortly after, Wheatley met and married John Peters, a free black grocer. They lived in poor conditions and two of their babies died.


John was improvident and was imprisoned for debt in 1784. With a sickly infant son to provide for, Phillis became a scullery maid at a boarding house, work she had not done before. She died on December 5, 1784, at the age of 31. Her infant son died soon after.


Phillis Wheatley wrote a letter to Reverend Samson Occom, commending him on his ideas and beliefs stating that enslaved people should be given their natural-born rights in America. Wheatley also exchanged letters with the British philanthropist John Thornton, who discussed Wheatley and her poetry in correspondence with John Newton. Along with her poetry, she was able to express her thoughts, comments and concerns to others.


In 1775, she sent a copy of a poem entitled ""To His Excellency, George Washington"" to the then-military general. The following year, Washington invited Wheatley to visit him at his headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she did in March 1776. Thomas Paine republished the poem in the Pennsylvania Gazette in April 1776.


In 1779 Wheatley issued a proposal for a second volume of poems but was unable to publish it because she had lost her patrons after her emancipation; publication of books was often based on gaining subscriptions for guaranteed sales beforehand. The American Revolutionary War (1775â1783) was also a factor. However, some of her poems that were to be included in the second volume were later published in pamphlets and newspapers.


In 1768, Wheatley wrote ""To the King's Most Excellent Majesty"", in which she praised King George III for repealing the Stamp Act. As the American Revolution gained strength, Wheatley's writing turned to themes that expressed ideas of the rebellious colonists.


In 1770 Wheatley wrote a poetic tribute to the evangelist George Whitefield. Her poetry expressed Christian themes, and many poems were dedicated to famous figures. Over one-third consist of elegies, the remainder being on religious, classical, and abstract themes. She seldom referred to her own life in her poems. One example of a poem on slavery is ""On being brought from Africa to America"":


Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
""Their colour is a diabolic dye.""
Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.


Many colonists found it difficult to believe that an African slave was writing ""excellent"" poetry. Wheatley had to defend her authorship of her poetry in court in 1772. She was examined by a group of Boston luminaries, including John Erving, Reverend Charles Chauncey, John Hancock, Thomas Hutchinson, the governor of Massachusetts, and his lieutenant governor Andrew Oliver. They concluded she had written the poems ascribed to her and signed an attestation, which was included in the preface of her book of collected works: Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, published in London in 1773. Publishers in Boston had declined to publish it, but her work was of great interest to influential people in London.


There, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and the Earl of Dartmouth acted as patrons to help Wheatley gain publication. Her poetry received comment in The London Magazine in 1773, which published as a ""specimen"" of her work her poem 'Hymn to the Morning', and said: ""these poems display no astonishing works of genius, but when we consider them as the productions of a young, untutored African, who wrote them after six months careful study of the English language, we cannot but suppress our admiration for talents so vigorous and lively."" Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral was printed in 11 editions until 1816.


In 1778, the African-American poet Jupiter Hammon wrote an ode to Wheatley (""An Address to Miss Phillis Wheatley""). His master Lloyd had temporarily moved with his slaves to Hartford, Connecticut, during the Revolutionary War. Hammon thought that Wheatley had succumbed to what he believed were pagan influences in her writing, and so his ""Address"" consisted of 21 rhyming quatrains, each accompanied by a related Bible verse, that he thought would compel Wheatley to return to a Christian path in life.


In 1838 Boston-based publisher and abolitionist Isaac Knapp published a collection of Wheatley's poetry, along with that of enslaved North Carolina poet George Moses Horton, under the title Memoir and Poems of Phillis Wheatley, A Native African and a Slave. Also, Poems by a Slave. Wheatley's memoir was earlier published in 1834 by Geo W. Light but did not include poems by Horton.



Thomas Jefferson, in his book Notes on the State of Virginia, was unwilling to acknowledge the value of her work or the work of any black poet. He wrote:

Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry. Love is the peculiar oestrum of the poet. Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses only, not the imagination. Religion indeed has produced a Phyllis Whately but it could not produce a poet. The compositions published under her name are below the dignity of criticism.

Wheatley believed that the power of poetry was immeasurable. John C. Shields, noting that her poetry did not simply reflect the literature she read but was based on her personal ideas and beliefs, writes:


""Wheatley had more in mind than simple conformity. It will be shown later that her allusions to the sun god and to the goddess of the morn, always appearing as they do here in close association with her quest for poetic inspiration, are of central importance to her.""

This poem is arranged into three stanzas of four lines in iambic tetrameter, followed by a concluding couplet in iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme is ABABCC. Shields sums up her writing as being ""contemplative and reflective rather than brilliant and shimmering.""


She repeated three primary elements: Christianity, classicism, and hierophantic solar worship. The hierophantic solar worship was part of what she brought with her from Africa; the worship of sun gods is expressed as part of her African culture, which may be why she used so many different words for the sun.  For instance, she uses Aurora eight times, ""Apollo seven, Phoebus twelve, and Sol twice."" Shields believes that the word ""light"" is significant to her as it marks her African history, a past that she has left physically behind. He notes that Sun is a homonym for Son, and that Wheatley intended a double reference to Christ. Wheatley also refers to ""heav'nly muse"" in two of her poems: ""To a Clergy Man on the Death of his Lady"" and ""Isaiah LXIII,"" signifying her idea of the Christian deity.


Classical allusions are prominent in Wheatley's poetry, which Shields argues set her work apart from that of her contemporaries: ""Wheatley's use of classicism distinguishes her work as original and unique and deserves extended treatment."" Particularly extended engagement with the Classics can be found in the poem ""To Maecenas"", where Wheatley uses references to Maecenas to depict the relationship between her and her own patrons,:â168â728â as well as making reference to Achilles and Patroclus, Homer and Virgil.:â167â At the same time, Wheatley indicates to the complexity of her relationship with Classical texts by pointing to the sole example of Terence as an ancestor for her works: 


The happier Terence all the choir inspir'd,


His soul replenish'd, and his bosom fir'd;
But say, ye Muses, why this partial grace,



To one alone of Afric's sable race;:â168â

While some scholars have argued that Wheatley's allusions to classical material are based on the reading of other neoclassical poetry (such as the works of Alexander Pope), Emily Greenwood has demonstrated that Wheatley's work demonstrates persistent linguistic engagement with Latin texts, suggesting good familiarity with the ancient works themselves.:â159â62â Both Shields and Greenwood have argued that Wheatley's use of classical imagery and ideas was designed to deliver ""subversive"" messages to her educated, majority white audience, and argue for the freedom of Wheatley herself and other enslaved people.:â170â2â:â252â


Black literary scholars from the 1960s to the present in critiquing Wheatley's writing have noted the absence in it of her sense of identity as a black enslaved person. A number of black literary scholars have viewed her workâand its widespread admirationâas a barrier to the development of black people during her time and as a prime example of Uncle Tom syndrome, believing that Wheatley's lack of awareness of her condition of enslavement furthers this syndrome among descendants of Africans in the Americas.


Some scholars thought Wheatley's perspective came from her upbringing. The Wheatley family took interest in her at a young age because of her timid and submissive nature. Using this to their advantage, the Wheatley family was able to mold and shape her into a person of their liking. The family separated her from other slaves in the home and she was prevented from doing anything other than very light housework.  This shaping prevented Phillis from ever becoming a threat to the Wheatley family or other people from the white community.  As a result, Phillis was allowed to attend white social events and this created a misconception of the relationship between black and white people for her.


The matter of Wheatley's autobiography, ""a white woman's memoir"", has been a subject of investigation. In 2020, American poet HonorÃ©e Fanonne Jeffers published her The Age of Phillis, based on the understanding that Margaretta Matilda Odell's account of Wheatley's life portrayed Wheatley inaccurately, and as a character in a sentimental novel; the poems by Jeffers attempt to fill in the gaps and recreate a more realistic portrait of Wheatley.


With the 1773 publication of Wheatley's book Poems on Various Subjects, she ""became the most famous African on the face of the earth."" Voltaire stated in a letter to a friend that Wheatley had proved that black people could write poetry. John Paul Jones asked a fellow officer to deliver some of his personal writings to ""Phillis the African favorite of the Nine (muses) and Apollo."" She was honored by many of America's founding fathers, including George Washington, who wrote to her (after she wrote a poem in his honor) that ""the style and manner [of your poetry] exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical Talents.""


Critics consider her work fundamental to the genre of African-American literature, and she is honored as the first African-American woman to publish a book of poetry and the first to make a living from her writing.


In 1892 a Phyllis Wheatley Circle was formed in Greenville, Mississippi.:â72â and in 1896 the Phyllis Wheatley Circle.:â108â


She is commemorated on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.  The Phyllis Wheatley YWCA in Washington, D.C. and the Phillis Wheatley High School in Houston, Texas, are named for her, as was the historic Phillis Wheatley School in Jensen Beach, Florida, now the oldest building on the campus of American Legion Post 126 (Jensen Beach, Florida).  A branch of the Richland County Library in Columbia, South Carolina, which offered the first library services to black citizens, is named for her. Phillis Wheatley Elementary School, New Orleans, opened in 1954 in, TremÃ©, one of the oldest African-American neighborhoods in the US. The Phillis Wheatley Community Center opened in 1920 in Greenville, South Carolina, and in 1924 (spelled ""Phyllis"") in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


On July 16, 2019, at the London site where A. Bell Booksellers published Wheatley's first book in September 1773 (8 Aldgate, now the location of the Dorsett City Hotel), the unveiling took place of a commemorative blue plaque honoring her, organized by the Nubian Jak Community Trust and Black History Walks.

When Wendell saves Conor's life, Wendell takes advantage of it by having Conor perform various crazy tasks for him. Then Wendell moves in with Conor after termites were found to be in his house. Meanwhile, Franklin costs Ashley her job when he demands that Billy gives her a 100 percent raise. Franklin and Ashley come up with a plan to get her job back by having Billy hire someone worse than her. Unfortunately for them, Stu, the new employee, is excellent at the job, but that also becomes terrible when it causes Billy's restaurant to be packed. After Stu overhears Franklin, Ashley, and Billy talking about having Ashley fire him, he quits and Ashley gets her job back with a 10 percent raise, which Billy had originally offered. Elsewhere, Conor loses it and asks Franklin to act like termites also attacked his house in order to get Wendell to leave. It works, but then a ceiling fan almost falls on Conor and Franklin saves his life, causing the cycle to repeat itself.


Due to an incident at a football state championship game, once a year it is Freak Week and Mr. Spanks gives students and faculty alike detention for no reason whatsoever, such as a student simply smiling. Conor goes to see Coach Wilson and asks about letting Mr. Spanks play the upcoming game because he sat out his freshman year, which meant he still had eligibility left. Conor and Ashley later make a plan to help Mr. Spanks gain his confidence back in return for canceling all of the detention he dished out. Meanwhile, Wendell is jealous that Franklin will be the school mascot. Franklin later performs a long cheer for Janice, but Wendell comes and crashes it with a better cheer and Janice makes him the mascot. However, Wendell ends up in a dirty costume when Franklin reveals that the awesome costume he was in was made by him and his mother. Meanwhile, while Conor and Ashley are helping Mr. Spanks, he continues to come up with lame excuses as to why he can't participate in the game, such as not being able to kick the football properly, but Ashley trash talks him and he gains his confidence back. Later at the game, Janice reveals she let Wendell be the mascot so he would get booed. Mr. Spanks is then put into the game, but double-crosses Conor when he refuses to cancel the detentions he dished out. Unfortunately for Mr. Spanks, he is tackled by everyone on the field, causing Mr. Spanks to break his legs and the cycle to repeat itself. Conor and Ashley then ask Mr. Spanks if it's okay to go to a yacht party and bring everyone; when he says no, they intentionally misunderstand him and tell everyone that detention's over.


Conor and his friends are going to appear on the front cover of a gaming magazine. They have to promote a product called the Gamer Grips. However, soon they discover that the gloves make everything fall out of their hands, so they decide not to promote it. Their rival, Lika, decides to promote the product and steals their place on the magazine cover. In response, Conor's team decides to promote another product, the Chillerz, which are making an even bigger advertising campaign. But the shorts start malfunctioning, causing them to get very cold, so in the live interview they decide to tell people about its dangers. Meanwhile, Lika is questioned about the Gamer Grips which have been discovered to cause temporary hand shrinkage, but she keeps denying it despite the evidence.

The ChÃ¢teau Malou is situated at an altitude of 52 metres (171 feet).


The chÃ¢teau was built in 1776 in the neoclassical style by a wealthy merchant called Lambert de Lamberts. The current building replaced a small 17th-century hunting lodge.


One of the chÃ¢teau's owners was the orangist minister Pierre van Gobbelschroy, until the end of the Dutch period in 1829. After Belgium gained its independence from The United Kingdom of Netherlands, the chÃ¢teau changed owners and eventually passed to the Finance Minister of the new Belgian government, Jules Malou (1810â1886). Malou occupied the building from 1853 onwards and the building has retained his name ever since.


The chÃ¢teau is now the property of the municipality of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and is primarily used for cultural activities, exhibitions, etc.


The chÃ¢teau is situated in the middle of Malou Park, overlooking the valley of the Woluwe stream. There is a formal lawn in front of the chÃ¢teau, and beyond, there is a small lake with swans and ducks.

33367890,Knightmare (Camelot),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare_(Camelot),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knightmare_(Camelot)&action=info,"Knightmare was a custom roller coaster at the now defunct Camelot Theme Park in Chorley, Lancashire, United Kingdom. It was built by Zierer, and designed by Anton Schwarzkopf.


It was originally built in 1987 for a theme park in Kobe, Japan called Portopialand (now defunct) under the name BMRX'/'Bavarian Mountain Railroad, and was a dark indoor ride with a huge mountain themed structure surrounding it. After Portopialand closed in March 2006, the roller coaster was acquired by Camelot theme park and was dismantled and shipped to the United Kingdom. It cost the park Â£3Â million to build the roller coaster. 


The track and trains arrived at Camelot at the end of 2006, without the mountain structure that initially enclosed it. At the beginning of 2007, the reconstruction began, with the ride finally opening to the public in the summer of 2007, as Knightmare. The coaster originally featured five different coloured trains. When relaunched at Camelot, the park refurbished three of the five trains. 


Some of the steam train theming was removed (such as the funnel and headlights) from the front of the trains. The three trains were painted differently with one being partly maroon, one partly purple and the other partly green. The other two trains were placed in storage at the park. Each train had a capacity of 14 persons, and the ride had a minimum height restriction of 1.3 metres (4Â ft 3Â in).


The ride takes the train up a semi spiral chain lift to its tallest point at 87Â feet, then drops the train into an overbanked turn. The ride then takes passengers through various sharp turns, multiple helixes and a near-vertical bend (nicknamed ""the psycho drop"") halfway through where they experience almost 5G, reaching speeds of about 40Â mph.


The ride was over a half mile long, and lasted just under two minutes. Knightmare was arguably one of the most intense rollercoasters in the United Kingdom, and at the time of opening had the highest g-force of any roller coaster in the United Kingdom.


It was located in the Land of the Brave area of the park, situated on the former sites of Camelot's long defunct flagship roller coasters (The Tower of Terror and The Gauntlet); it was also next to the site of the ride Excalibur 2. Knightmare is one of only three of its kind in the world, Jetline at GrÃ¶na Lund (clone) and Lisebergbanan at Liseberg (custom layout). 


After having trouble with low visitor numbers, The Story Group and Knights Leisure Limited announced that they were permanently closing Camelot Theme Park in November 2012, after twenty nine years. The rollercoaster remained SBNO (standing but not operating) within the abandoned park since 2012 until 2020. 


In recent years, there were incidents regarding safety concerns of urban explorers climbing 80Â ft to the top of the rollercoaster's lift hill, gaining much national media attention.


In February 2020, it was seen that Knightmare had begun being dismantled. It was hoped that the ride was being removed to be refurbished and relocated, however on closer inspection, it is clear that the coaster was being torn to the ground by demolition company, âSquibbâ.


Up until that point, it was hoped that the coaster could be rescued and refurbished by another park, however due to the effects of being left SBNO for nearly eight years, the coaster was likely beyond repair, and would be far too expensive to get it operating again.


In March 2015, internet rumours circulated throughout many rollercoaster forums that Southport Pleasureland were targeting the Knightmare rollercoaster as a new addition to the park, though Pleasureland owner Norman Wallis was very vague in addressing these rumours.


In May 2017, the Blackpool Gazette reported the first public sighting of a Knightmare rollercoaster train since Camelot's closure, in which the train slipped off the back of a lorry transporting it and fell onto the middle of a road in Thornton, there were no injuries in the incident. The condition of the train itself is still unknown.


In August 2017, Southport Pleasureland denied all rumours of their involvement with Knightmare, despite photographic evidence of the Knightmare trains being seen in park storage, stating in their response to a theme park news website in the United Kingdom, Ride Rater, that ""we don't have it"".",1,10 October 2011, 1 July 2021,62,0,0

The Wiener BÃ¼rgertheater was erected in 1905 in the Third District (3 Bezirk), at Vordere ZollamtsstraÃe 13. It was designed by the architects Franz von Krauss and Josef TÃ¶lk. The official opening took place on December 7, 1905, with the performance of Der alte Herr (The Old Man), by Beatrice Dvorsky with the mayor of Vienna, Karl Lueger, attending.


The first director was actor and author Oskar Fronz, who managed the theatre until his death in 1925. The venue was unsuccessful in its early years until Fronz adapted the BÃ¼rgertheater for operetta performances in 1910 and Edmund Eysler became the house composer. From 1926, Revue-operettas were common, particularly those featuring Karl Farkas and his partner, Fritz GrÃ¼nbaum. The theatre closed in the early years of World War II, but reopened under the direction of Robert Valberg in 1942.


In September 1945, Franz Stoss was named director, and the BÃ¼rgertheater became a satellite theatre of the Theater in der Josefstadt. In 1953, Stoss was followed by Harald RÃ¶bbeling who renamed the BÃ¼rgertheater BroadwaybÃ¼hne (Broadway-stage) in an attempt to give it a new direction.  This was unsuccessful causing huge financial losses that forced the theatre to close. The building was subsequently used for, among other purposes, the transmission hub for the American occupying force and a sales exhibition which was previously housed at the Vienna Stock Exchange.


During the 1959-61 great death of the theatres in Vienna - in which the Wiener Stadttheater (in Laudongasse) and the ""Scala"", the former Johann Strauss Theater, were also affected - the BÃ¼rgertheater was demolished in 1960. The headquarters of a Viennese bank, Zentralsparkasse der Gemeinde Wien, was erected on the site, with a bridge over the adjoining slip road, designed by Arthur Perotti and Anton Potyka.

17629736,Nathaniel Reed (outlaw),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Reed_(outlaw),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nathaniel_Reed_(outlaw)&action=info,"Nathaniel ""Texas Jack"" Reed (March 23, 1862 â January 7, 1950) was a 19th-century American outlaw responsible for many stagecoach, bank, and train robberies throughout the American Southwest during the 1880s and '90s. He acted on his own and also led a bandit gang, operating particularly in the Rocky Mountains and Indian Territory.


Reed is claimed to have been the last survivor of the ""47 most notorious outlaws"" of Indian Territory. He became an evangelist in his later years, and could often be seen on the streets of Tulsa preaching against the dangers of following a ""life of crime"". His memoirs were published in the 1930s, and are considered valuable collectors' items (one copy was reportedly sold on the internet for $1,500 in 2007). He claimed to have ridden with the Dalton gang, Bill Doolin, Henry Starr and other outlaws and bandits of the old west. He may have also helped Cherokee Bill, a fellow outlaw from the Indian Territory, in his escape from Fort Smith during the 1880s.


As with many others of the era, Reed's colorful stories of his almost 10-year career as an outlaw were probably exaggerated by later writers. He claimed to have ridden briefly with the Daltons, and participated in their dual bank robberies in Coffeyville in 1892, as well as in the infamous 1893 gunfight at Ingalls. However, there is no corroborating evidence that he was involved in either of those events.


Reed was born in Madison County, Arkansas. His father, Mason Henry Reed, was killed in action fighting for the Union Army during the American Civil War, probably at the Battle of Campbell's Station on November 16, 1863. His mother was Sarah Elizabeth Prater. Reed lived with a number of relatives, including his maternal grandparents, until 1883 when, at the age of 21, he moved to the American frontier. He worked at various jobs in Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas until he reached Oklahoma, where he became a ranch hand for the Tarry outfit.


During the summer of 1885, his foreman recruited him to rob a train at La Junta, Colorado. In the course of the robbery, Reed entered the passenger car firing his pistol to keep the passengers under control. He later received $6,000 for his part in the hold up. Encouraged by this success, Reed gave up working as a cowboy and became an outlaw. During the next nine years he and his gang robbed trains, stagecoaches, banks and, on one occasion, captured a large shipment of bullion in California.


During the early 1890s, when he was living near Muskogee, Oklahoma, Reed learned that a gold shipment was leaving Dallas, Texas on November 13, 1894. He recruited Buz Luckey, William ""Will"" Smith and Tom Root, and selected Blackstone Switch at Wybark as the site for the robbery. The plan was for Reed to throw the switch as the train approached then, as it entered onto a sidetrack, the gang would use dynamite to enter the express car. Root, a full-blooded Cherokee known for his size and strength, would enter the express car, break open the strong boxes, and bring out the gold. Smith would hold a gun on the engineer and fireman while Luckey stayed with the horses.


Despite their practice staged-robbery the previous day, as the Katy No. 2 approached, Reed threw the switch too early. Engineer Joseph Hotchkiss stopped the train when he saw the signal light change, far short of the siding. Reed and the others were forced to run towards the train yelling and shooting. Hotchkiss and the fireman alerted the messengers using the bell cord connected to the car and jumped off the train to hide in a small ravine nearby.


The railroad company had anticipated the possibility of a robbery, and had moved the gold to another train, putting in its place several armed messengers to guard the express car including Bud Ledbetter, Paden Tolbert, Sid Johnson, Frank Jones. When Reed and the others approached the express car, he called for the messengers to leave the car. When they refused, Reed and Root took cover behind some trees and began shooting into the car. The messengers returned fire, resulting in a gunfight that lasted for nearly an hour. Eventually one of Reed's men was killed; Reed jumped onto the train and went through the passenger cars forcing passengers to put their valuables into a sack before he and his gang fled.


As they rode away, Reed was shot by Bud Ledbetter; the pain from his wound grew so severe that his partners were forced to leave him behind for the night. He gave them some of his loot, and kept the rest of it in a sack to use as a pillow. He lay on a blanket hiding under a rock ledge until he was found by an Indian woman, who nursed him back to health.


The American Express Company offered a reward of $250 for the arrest and conviction of each member of the gang. An extensive manhunt was conducted by U.S. Marshals George Crump and S. Morton Rutherford, and large groups of deputies were sent into the Indian Territory and Creek Nation. While burning the canebrakes in the Verdigris bottoms, one deputy found the burnt remains of Reed's saddle and threatened to destroy the crops of local residents if they did not turn over Reed and his men. This was considered a legal act, authorized by ""The Hanging Judge"" Isaac Parker himself, but no one came forward with information. Reed was warned of the search and decided to leave the territory as soon as he was able. He arrived in Seneca, Missouri on December 9, where Bill Lawrence took care of him.


Once fully recovered from his wounds Reed returned to Arkansas in February 1895, where he stayed with his brother in Madison County. Having decided to retire from a life of crime, he wrote to Judge Isaac Parker, agreeing to testify against the man who planned the robbery in exchange for probation, although he did not participate in the proceedings. Smith managed to disappear, but U.S. Marshal Newton LaForce was successful in tracking down Luckey and Root to the latter's home in Broken Arrow, 15Â miles south of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The two fugitives were subsequently killed in a gunfight with LaForce and his men on December 4, 1894.


Despite Parker's promise of immunity, Reed was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison. However, he served less than one, as shortly before his own death Parker granted Reed his parole, in November 1896. Reed subsequently carried his signed parole from Judge Parker around with him, along with a letter signed by Ledbetter acknowledging that Ledbetter had shot him.


After his release Reed became an evangelist, preaching the rewards of living a respectable, law-abiding life. He also toured the country with a series of Wild West shows. His memoirs, The Life of Texas Jack, were published in 1936, and 35,000Â copies of several published pamphlets and dime novels describing his life as an outlaw were sold before his death at home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 87.[citation needed] He was buried in St. Paul, Arkansas.",2,27 May 2008, 24 November 2020,123,0,0

598445,UNIX System V,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UNIX_System_V&action=info,"Unix System V (pronounced: ""System Five"") is one of the first commercial versions of the Unix operating system. It was originally developed by AT&T and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. System V Release 4 (SVR4) was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as Unix System Unification, which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features. System V is sometimes abbreviated to SysV.


As of 2021[update], the AT&T-derived Unix market is divided between four System V variants: IBM's AIX, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's HP-UX and Oracle's Solaris, plus the free-software illumos forked from OpenSolaris.


System V was the successor to 1982's UNIX System III. While AT&T developed and sold hardware that ran System V, most customers ran a version from a reseller, based on AT&T's reference implementation. A standards document called the System V Interface Definition outlined the default features and behavior of implementations.


During the formative years of AT&T's computer business, the division went through several phases of System V software groups, beginning with the Unix Support Group (USG), followed by Unix System Development Laboratory (USDL), followed by AT&T Information Systems (ATTIS), and finally Unix System Laboratories (USL).


In the 1980s and early-1990s, UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) were the two major versions of UNIX. Historically, BSD was also commonly called ""BSD Unix"" or ""Berkeley Unix"". Eric S. Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period:


In fact, for years after divestiture the Unix community was preoccupied with the first phase of the Unix warsÂ â an internal dispute, the rivalry between System V Unix and BSD Unix. The dispute had several levels, some technical (sockets vs. streams, BSD tty vs. System V termio) and some cultural. The divide was roughly between longhairs and shorthairs; programmers and technical people tended to line up with Berkeley and BSD, more business-oriented types with AT&T and System V.

While HP, IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings, other vendors such as Sun Microsystems and DEC extended BSD. Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC's Ultrix received System V features. AT&T and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based SunOS to produce Solaris, one of the primary System V descendants still in use today[when?]. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as POSIX and the success of Linux, the division between System V and BSD has become less important.


System V, known inside Bell Labs as Unix 5.0, succeeded AT&T's previous commercial Unix called System III in January, 1983.
Unix 4.0 was never released externally, which would have been designated as System IV.
This first release of System V (called System V.0, System V Release 1, or SVR1) was developed by AT&T's UNIX Support Group (USG) and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX 5.0.


System V also included features such as the vi editor and curses from 4.1 BSD, developed at the University of California, Berkeley; it also improved performance by adding buffer and inode caches. It also added support for inter-process communication using messages, semaphores, and shared memory, developed earlier for the Bell-internal CB UNIX.


SVR1 ran on DEC PDP-11 and VAX minicomputers.


AT&T's UNIX Support Group (USG) transformed into the UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL), which released System V Release 2 in 1984. SVR2 added shell functions and the SVID. SVR2.4 added demand paging, copy-on-write, shared memory, and record and file locking.


The concept of the ""porting base"" was formalized, and the DEC VAX-11/780 was chosen for this release. The ""porting base"" is the so-called original version of a release, from which all porting efforts for other machines emanate.


Educational source licenses for SVR2 were offered by AT&T for US$800 for the first CPU, and $400 for each additional CPU. A commercial source license was offered for $43,000, with three months of support, and a $16,000 price per additional CPU.


Apple Computer's A/UX operating system was initially based on this release. SCO XENIX also used SVR2 as its basis. The first release of HP-UX was also an SVR2 derivative.:â33â


Maurice J. Bach's book, The Design of the UNIX Operating System, is the definitive description of the SVR2 kernel.


AT&T's UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL) was succeeded by AT&T Information Systems (ATTIS), which distributed UNIX System V, Release 3, in 1987. SVR3 included STREAMS, Remote File Sharing (RFS), the File System Switch (FSS) virtual file system mechanism, a restricted form of shared libraries, and the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) network API. The final version was Release 3.2 in 1988, which added binary compatibility to Xenix on Intel platforms (see Intel Binary Compatibility Standard).


User interface improvements included the ""layers"" windowing system for the DMD 5620 graphics terminal, and the SVR3.2 curses libraries that offered eight or more color pairs and other at this time important features (forms, panels, menus, etc.). The AT&T 3B2 became the official ""porting base.""


SCO UNIX was based upon SVR3.2, as was ISC 386/ix. Among the more obscure distributions of SVR3.2 for the 386 were ESIX 3.2 by Everex and ""System V, Release 3.2"" sold by Intel themselves; these two shipped ""plain vanilla"" AT&T's codebase.


IBM's AIX operating system is an SVR3 derivative.


System V Release 4.0 was announced on October 18, 1988 and was incorporated into a variety of commercial Unix products from early 1989 onwards.  A joint project of AT&T Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems, it combined technology from:


New features included:


Many companies licensed SVR4 and bundled it with computer systems such as workstations and network servers. SVR4 systems vendors included Atari (Atari System V), Commodore (Amiga Unix), Data General (DG/UX), Fujitsu (UXP/DS), Hitachi (HI-UX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), NCR (Unix/NS), NEC (EWS-UX, UP-UX, UX/4800, SUPER-UX), OKI (OKI System V), Pyramid Technology (DC/OSx), SGI (IRIX), Siemens (SINIX), Sony (NEWS-OS), Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEIUX), and Sun Microsystems (Solaris) with illumos in the 2010s as the only open-source platform.


Software porting houses also sold enhanced and supported Intel x86 versions. SVR4 software vendors included Dell (Dell UNIX), Everex (ESIX), Micro Station Technology (SVR4), Microport (SVR4), and UHC (SVR4).


The primary platforms for SVR4 were Intel x86 and SPARC; the SPARC version, called Solaris 2 (or, internally, SunOS 5.x), was developed by Sun. The relationship between Sun and AT&T was terminated after the release of SVR4, meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR4.x releases. Sun would in 2005 release most of the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) as the open-source OpenSolaris project, creating, with its forks, the only open-source (albeit heavily modified) System V implementation available. After Oracle took over Sun, Solaris was forked into proprietary release, but illumos as the continuation project is being developed in open-source.


A consortium of Intel-based resellers including Unisys, ICL, NCR Corporation, and Olivetti developed SVR4.0MP with multiprocessing capability (allowing system calls to be processed from any processor, but interrupt servicing only from a ""master"" processor).


Release 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security) added security features required for Orange Book B2 compliance and Access Control Lists and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules.


In 1992, AT&T USL engaged in a joint venture with Novell, called Univel. That year saw the release System V.4.2 as Univel UnixWare, featuring the Veritas File System. Other vendors included UHC and Consensys. Release 4.2MP, completed late 1993, added support for multiprocessing and it was released as UnixWare 2 in 1995.


Eric S. Raymond warned prospective buyers about SVR4.2 versions, as they often did not include on-line man pages. In his 1994 buyers guide, he attributes this change in policy to Unix System Laboratories.


The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), owners of Xenix, eventually acquired the UnixWare trademark and the distribution rights to the System V Release 4.2 codebase from Novell, while other vendors (Sun, IBM, HP) continued to use and extend System V Release 4. Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to The Open Group. 


System V Release 5 was developed in 1997 by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) as a merger of SCO OpenServer (an SVR3-derivative) and UnixWare, with a focus on large-scale servers.:â23,â32â It was released as SCO UnixWare 7. SCO's successor, The SCO Group, also based SCO OpenServer 6 on SVR5, but the codebase is not used by any other major developer or reseller.


System V Release 6 was announced by SCO to be released by the end of 2004, but was apparently cancelled. It was supposed to support 64-bit systems. The industry has coalesced around The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification version 3 (UNIX 03). See also: Smallfoot


In the 1980s and 1990s, a variety of SVR4 versions of Unix were available commercially for the x86 PC platform. However, the market for commercial Unix on PCs declined after Linux and BSD became widely available. In late 1994, Eric S. Raymond discontinued his PC-clone UNIX Software Buyer's Guide on USENET, stating, ""The reason I am dropping this is that I run Linux now, and I no longer find the SVr4 market interesting or significant.""


In 1998, a confidential memo at Microsoft stated, ""Linux is on track to eventually own the x86 UNIX market"", and further predicted, ""I believe that LinuxÂ â moreso than NTÂ â will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future.""


An InfoWorld article from 2001 characterized SCO UnixWare as having a ""bleak outlook"" due to being ""trounced"" in the market by Linux and Solaris, and IDC predicted that SCO would ""continue to see a shrinking share of the market"".


Project Monterey was started in 1998 to combine major features of existing commercial Unix platforms, as a joint project of Compaq, IBM, Intel, SCO, and Sequent Computer Systems. The target platform was meant to be Intel's new IA-64 architecture and Itanium line of processors. However, the project was abruptly canceled in 2001 after little progress.


By 2001, several major Unix variants such as SCO UnixWare, Compaq Tru64 UNIX, and SGI IRIX were all in decline. The three major Unix versions doing well in the market were IBM AIX, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, and Sun's Solaris.


In 2006, when SGI declared bankruptcy, analysts questioned whether Linux would replace proprietary Unix altogether. In a 2006 article written for Computerworld by Mark Hall, the economics of Linux were cited as a major factor driving the migration from Unix to Linux:


Linux's success in high-end, scientific and technical computing, like Unix's before it, preceded its success in your data center. Once Linux proved itself by executing the most complex calculations possible, IT managers quickly grasped that it could easily serve Web pages and run payroll. Naturally, it helps to be lucky: Free, downloadable Linux's star began to rise during one of the longest downturns in IT history. With companies doing more with less, one thing they could dump was Unix.

The article also cites trends in high-performance computing applications as evidence of a dramatic shift from Unix to Linux:


A look at the Top500 list of supercomputers tells the tale best. In 1998, Unix machines from Sun and SGI combined for 46% of the 500 fastest computers in the world. Linux accounted for one (0.2%). In 2005, Sun had 0.8%Â â or four systemsÂ â and SGI had 3.6%, while 72% of the Top500 ran Linux.

In a November 2015 survey of the top 500 supercomputers, Unix was used by only 1.2% (all running IBM AIX), while Linux was used by 98.8%; the same survey in November 2017 reports 100% of them using Linux.


System V derivatives continued to be deployed on some proprietary server platforms. The principal variants of System V that remain in commercial use are AIX (IBM), Solaris (Oracle), and HP-UX (HP). According to a study done by IDC, in 2012 the worldwide Unix market was divided between IBM (56%), Oracle (19.2%), and HP (18.6%). No other commercial Unix vendor had more than 2% of the market. Industry analysts generally characterize proprietary Unix as having entered a period of slow but permanent decline.


OpenSolaris and its derivatives are the only SVR4 descendants that are open-source software. 
Core system software continues to be developed as illumos used in illumos distributions such as SmartOS, Omniosce, OpenIndiana and others.


The System V interprocess communication mechanisms are available in Unix-like operating systems not derived from System V; in particular, in Linux (a reimplementation of Unix) as well as the BSD derivative FreeBSD. POSIX 2008 specifies a replacement for these interfaces.


FreeBSD maintains a binary compatibility layer for the COFF format, which allows FreeBSD to execute binaries compiled for some SVR3.2 derivatives such as SCO UNIX and Interactive UNIX. Modern System V, Linux, and BSD platforms use the ELF file format for natively compiled binaries.",32,15 April 2004, 2 July 2021,504,0,0

After receiving her Ph.D. from the City University of New York Graduate Center in 1980, she taught at Princeton University, Yale University, the City University of New York, the University of Arizona, and the University of Pennsylvania.


After publishing A Rainbow for the Christian West (1977), an introduction to RenÃ© Depestre's poetry and a translation of his long poem Un arc-en-ciel pour l'occident chrÃ©tien, she turned to early American literature and published Fables of Mind: An Inquiry into Poe's Fiction (1987). Haiti, History, and the Gods (1995, 1998) reorients the study of Haitian history through what she calls ""literary fieldwork"". In the process, she recasts many boundaries: between politics and poetics, between the secular and the sacred, and between the colonizer and the colonized, those who deemed themselves masters and those who worked as slaves. The Story of Cruel and Unusual (2007), focuses on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and traces the precedents for the torture of detainees in the ""war on terror"". 


Chosen as one of top-25 books for 2011, The Law is a White Dog, How Legal Rituals Make and Unmake Persons was published by Princeton University Press in Spring 2011.  Her next book, With Dogs at the Edge of Life (2016) moves seamlessly between memoir, case law, and film. With dogs in the lead, we watch the breath and fury and flexing of life at the edgesânot the precondition for uniqueness but rather an imperative to seek a voracious communion with the nonhumans in our midsts. Dayanâs memoir In the Belly of Her Ghost (2019) takes readers to the Jim Crow South through the voice of her mother, who appears as muse, fury, and haunt. A ritual of memory, as well as a confession, this story captures racial terror, as well as a love so fierce that it takes the pulse of the South, its cruelties and its grit. ANIMAL QUINTET, her new memoir, returns to the South, this time through the lives of animals--ranging from war horses led by Civil War generals and doomed Spanish fighting bulls to the possum hunted by generations of Southerners. 


Dayan has received an NEH fellowship (1986); a Guggenheim fellowship (2005) recognized her work on conditions of disfigured personhood and civil death that long outlive slavery itself.

The last passenger service to the station was Amtrak's Chesapeake from 1978 to 1983. The brick station building still remains along the Northeast Corridor tracks.


The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad was completed from Wilmington to Baltimore in 1837 (save for the Susquehanna River ferry), with stops at most population centers including Elkton. A test train ran from Wilmington to Elkton on January 9, 1837, though service did not begin until July 31 of that year. A replacement station was built in 1855. The line became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1881.


The line originally ran on a tight curve through the town center, disrupting traffic and creating a collision hazard at grade crossings, as well as acting as a major speed restriction on express trains. In 1934, the PRR moved the line north of the downtown area to ease the curve and eliminate all grade crossings in Elkton. Construction on a new station began in February 1935 and was completed several months later. The new brick depot included baggage and waiting rooms, and a pedestrian passage under the tracks to the southbound platform. By 1938 Elkton was served by 18 trains per day.


Traffic declined after the construction of the Interstate Highway System; stopping service declined to three daily trains by 1963 and ended several years later. The line passed to Penn Central and eventually to Amtrak with all trains passing Elkton without stopping.


On April 30, 1978, Amtrak began operation of the Chesapeake, a once-daily commuter train between Philadelphia and Washington D.C., which included reopening several closed stations.


On January 1, 1983, the obligation for Conrail to provide commuter service on rail lines it had taken over in 1976 ended. SEPTA Regional Rail took over Philadelphia-area lines, while Amtrak began operating service in Maryland under contract to MARC. Now largely redundant to Amtrak intercity and MARC regional service, the Chesapeake was cut on October 30, 1983. SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line ran as far south as Newark, Delaware, while MARC service ran as far north as Perryville, Maryland. Elkton station, the only station in the gap between the two, was abandoned.


Elkton is proposed to be revived as a station on an extension of MARC's Penn Line to Newark, Delaware.

Despite finding some happiness together, Chun Tung and Chloe have little in the way of understanding and trust between each other and, with only minimal help from May, the couple part.


However, May realises that Chloe has truly fallen in love with Chun Tung. May sees in Chloe's latest film performance a rejection of things that Chloe had previously held dear and that the only reason for this is that her breaking with Chun Tung has broken her spirit. Filled with guilt May attempts to help Chun Tung understand Chloe in the hope that in doing so he can come to love the real Chloe and not the illusion presented to the world.


As they negotiate the travails of life and love, Chloe and Chun Tung's lives cross and touch with other couples making their own choices. Chung Ping Leung (Wai Ka Hung) and Elsa (Tracy Ip) are kindred souls, well matched by personality but not by physique. Nick (King Kong Lee) and Hayley (Rachel Kan) have both been scarred by bad relationships and are unable to form meaningful bonds with the opposite sex. However, when Nick becomes impotent they find that they have more in common than just a long history of one-night stands. Poon Chun Him's (Kenny Wong) relationships are perpetually out of sync. Whenever he is ready for marriage his girlfriends are not and vice versa. When his friends Yeung Chi Wah (Patrick Dunn) and Fung Yiu Dan, Kelly (Elvina Kong) divorce after it is discovered that Yeung has been harbouring a secret homosexual infatuation for him, Poon and Kelly find themselves being drawn to each other, but this time will their timing be in sync?",1,3 June 2011, 25 August 2020,102,0,0

The Fort Worth and Denver City Railway Company (FW&DC) was chartered by the Texas Legislature on May 26, 1873. The company later changed its name to the Fort Worth and Denver Railway Company (FW&D) on August 7, 1951.


The main line of the railroad ran from Fort Worth through Wichita Falls, Childress, Amarillo, and Dalhart, to Texline, where it connected with the rails of parent company Colorado and Southern Railway, both of which became subsidiaries of the Burlington Route in 1908.


At the end of 1970, FW&D operated 1,201Â mi (1,933Â km) of road on 1,577Â mi (2,538Â km) of track; that year it reported 1493 million ton-miles of revenue freight. (Those totals may or may not include the former Burlington-Rock Island Railroad.) In 1980, operated mileage had dropped to 1181, but freight was 7732 million ton-miles; the tide of coal had begun.


The Panic of 1873 delayed the start of construction until 1881, when Grenville M. Dodge became interested in the project.  As chief engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad, Dodge had played a large part in the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad.  Dodge organized the Texas and Colorado Railway Improvement Company in 1881 to build and equip the FW&DC in return for $20,000 in stock and $20,000 in bonds for each mile of track laid.  In the same year, the FW&DC and the Denver and New Orleans Railroad Company, organized in Colorado, agreed to connect their systems at the Texas-New Mexico border. The FW&DC received no state subsidy other than the right-of-way easements to cross state-owned lands totaling 2,162 acres (8.75Â km2).


Construction began at Hodge Junction, just north of Fort Worth, on November 27, 1881, and by September 1882, Dodge had completed 110Â mi (180Â km) of track to Wichita Falls, Texas. By 1885, the line reached Harrold; by 1886, Chillicothe; by 1887, Clarendon and Amarillo; and by 1888, Texline on the New Mexico border.  Continuing into the New Mexico Territory, the FW&DC finally linked with the D&NO where the railheads met at Union Park, near present-day Folsom, New Mexico, 528Â mi (850Â km) from Fort Worth, on March 14, 1888.


Service between Fort Worth and Denver began on April 1, 1888. In 1895, Dodge became president of the company, one of several railroads in which he held a financial interest.


In 1899, the FW&DC was acquired by the Colorado and Southern Railway, successor to the D&NO.  The C&S itself was bought by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1908, but the three companies continued to operate as separate legal entities. In part, this separation was due to Texas law, which required all railroads operating in the state to have their headquarters in Texas.  This had the effect of requiring all operating railroads in Texas to be wholly owned, but independent companies of the regional or national roads.


The FW&DC was the first rail line to penetrate the northwest part of Texas, which contributed greatly to the growth of Texas cities such as Wichita Falls, Childress, Amarillo, and Dalhart. In addition, the railroad actively promoted settlement of the rural areas it served, providing free seeds, trees, and tree seedlings to farmers and ranchers to promote cotton- and wheat-growing, as well as erosion prevention.


In the first four decades of the 20th century, the FW&DC built or acquired a number of feeder lines in its territory, so that by 1940, the Burlington-owned system operated 1,031Â mi (1,659Â km) of main track in Texas in addition to the Burlington-Rock Island Railroad.


The Fort Worth and Denver City leased the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains (completed in 1928, 206Â mi (332Â km) from Estelline to Plainview and Lubbock; the Fort Worth and Denver Northern (completed in 1932, 110Â mi (180Â km) from Childress to Pampa); and the Fort Worth and Denver Terminal (providing access to railyards and terminals in Fort Worth). In reality, all three lines were projects of the parent company from the outset.


Several feeder lines operated by the Wichita Valley Railway Company (another subsidiary of the Colorado and Southern) connected with the FW&DC at Wichita Falls, including the Wichita Valley Railway (Wichita Falls to Seymour), the Wichita Valley Railroad (Seymour to Stamford), the Abilene and Northern (Stamford to Abilene, Texas), the Stamford & Northwestern (Stamford to Spur), and the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma Railway (Wichita Falls to Byers and Waurika, Oklahoma).  In 1952, the Wichita Valley and its subsidiaries were merged into the Fort Worth and Denver Railway.


In 1925, the FW&DC had extended service from Fort Worth to Dallas by acquiring trackage rights over the Rock Island Railroad between those cities.  At Dallas, FW&DC trains connected with the Burlington-Rock Island Railroad for through service to Houston.


The premier passenger train of the FW&DC was the streamlined Texas Zephyr (trains #1 and 2), which operated between Dallas and Denver from August 22, 1940, to September 11, 1967.  Other passenger trains included the Gulf Coast Special (train #7), the Colorado Special (train #8), and the Sam Houston Zephyr (trains #3 and 4), as well as motorcars over the South Plains line between Childress and Lubbock and over the Wichita Valley between Wichita Falls and Abilene.  At the railroad's peak in 1944, during the World War II economic boom, the Texas Railroad Commission reported that the FW&DC earned $12,132,515 in freight revenue, $5,839,399 in passenger revenue, and $1,488,095 in other revenue.  However, by 1972, in the face of competition from interstate highway traffic and airlines, the Fort Worth and Denver owned 20 locomotives and 1,520 freight cars, but operated at a loss of $1,743,551.


In 1970, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, the Great Northern Railway, and the Northern Pacific Railroad merged themselves into a single railroad, the Burlington Northern Railroad, but their subsidiaries in Colorado and Texas continued to have a separate legal existence until the Burlington Northern acquired the Fort Worth and Denver Railway by virtue of the merger between BN and the Colorado and Southern Railroad on December 31, 1981. The Fort Worth and Denver Railway's corporate existence came to an end when it was formally merged into Burlington Northern Railroad on December 31, 1982.


The FW&D's former main line through the Texas Panhandle and North Texas is now a heavily used route of BN's successor, the BNSF Railway, primarily for coal and intermodal trains between Fort Worth and the western United States.  Additionally, the Union Pacific Railroad has trackage rights on this line from Fort Worth to Dalhart.  No passenger trains have operated in scheduled revenue service on this route, though, since the FW&D ended all passenger service in 1967, before the creation of Amtrak in 1971.


In 1989, BN abandoned the former Fort Worth and Denver South Plains trackage between Estelline and Lubbock.  In 1993, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department acquired 64Â mi (103Â km) of the abandoned right-of-way between Estelline and the town of South Plains to create the Caprock Canyons State Park and Trailway's hike and bike trail.

43552541,James Herrington,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Herrington,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Herrington&action=info,"James Herrington (June 6, 1824 â July 7, 1890) was an American politician from Pennsylvania. Coming with his family to Illinois at a young age, he joined a Chicago printing house to support his family. He apprenticed under Long John Wentworth and became a prominent Democrat upon his return to Geneva. He served seven consecutive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives and was once a candidate for the United States House of Representatives. When the office was created in 1887, Herrington became the first Mayor of Geneva.


James Herrington was born in Mercer County, Pennsylvania on June 6, 1824. His father would become one of the founders of Kane County, Illinois. Herrington moved with his family to Chicago, Illinois in 1833. The next year, his father sold the property and purchased a claim west in what is now Geneva, Illinois.


In 1839, his father died, so Herrington moved back to Chicago to apprentice in the printer's trade. He worked in the Chicago Democrat offices for seven years under future Mayor of Chicago and U.S. Representative Long John Wentworth, who became a mentor. Herrington returned to Geneva in 1849, where he was elected Kane County Clerk. He served in this position for eight years, dealing in real estate and publishing on the side. He bought a farm in Blackberry Township in 1863.


Herrington was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1872 as a Democrat. His views on corporate personhood proved popular with his district. He for twelve years in the lower house, finally defeated by Thomas O'Donnell in 1884. Herrington then returned to Geneva. He supported Carter Harrison, Sr.'s campaign for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in 1885; the nomination instead went to William Ralls Morrison. Herrington served one last term in the Illinois House from 1886 to 1888.


Herrington was elected the first Mayor of Geneva in 1887, shortly after the town authorized the position. However, he resigned a few months later due to a conflict with the city council over saloon licenses. In 1888, the Democratic Party nominated Herrington to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, but he was defeated in his strongly Republican district.


Herrington married Mary A. Blodgett on January 14, 1850. They had ten children, nine surviving to adulthood. Herrington died on July 7, 1890. He had been suffering from paralysis for the last year, which worsened a few weeks before his death. His death was front-page news on the Chicago Inter Ocean.",1,13 August 2014, 7 April 2021,16,0,0

The Bulldogs finished 5th in the Southeastern Conference in their sixth straight bowl season and first Sun Bowl since 1969. The Wildcats finished tied for 2nd in the Pacific-10 Conference in their first bowl appearance since 1979 and first Sun Bowl since 1968.


Steve Crumley gave Georgia a 3-0 lead on his 37 yard field goal, though he re-injured a pulled muscle in his leg, keeping him out the rest of the game. Max Zendejas tied it on a 21 yard field goal to make it 3-3. Less than five minutes into the second half, Zendejas made it 6-3 on field goal from 51 yards out. Martin Rudolph returned an interception 35 yards for a touchdown to make it 13-6. Backup Davis Jacobs made it 13-6 on his 44 yard field goal with 13:20 left. Running back James Debow fumbled the ball at the 23 to give the ball back to the Bulldogs with 12:35 remaining. Georgia would score three minutes later on a Lars Tate touchdown run. With 1:14 remaining, Jacobs missed a field goal from 44 yards to keep it 13-13. The Wildcats drove to the 22, calling timeout to set up a 39 yard attempt by Zendejas. However, his kick went wide, keeping the game a tie. Despite this, he was named MVP. This remains the final tie in Sun Bowl history (since 1996, games cannot end in a tie). Alfred Jenkins went 13-of-22 for 133 yards for Arizona. Tate went 71 yards on 22 carries for Georgia. Zendejas was named MVP on his 2 for 3 success in attempting field goals.


The Wildcats went to the Aloha Bowl the following year, in Smith's last season with the team. Neither team has been to the Sun Bowl since this game.

13403486,Fifty Mission Cap,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Mission_Cap,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fifty_Mission_Cap&action=info,"""Fifty Mission Cap"" is a song by Canadian rock group The Tragically Hip. It was released in January 1993 as the second single from the band's third full-length album, Fully Completely. It was first played in front of a live concert audience at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on December 16, 1991. 


The song is a tribute to Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Bill Barilko, reintroducing Barilko's story to a younger generation, and is among The Tragically Hip's most popular songs.


The song's lyrics describe the mysterious disappearance of Barilko, who scored the Stanley Cup clinching goal for the Leafs over Montreal Canadiens in the 1951 cup finals. Four months and five days later, Barilko departed on a fishing trip in a small, single-engine airplane with friend and dentist, Henry Hudson. The plane disappeared between Rupert House and Timmins, Ontario, leaving no trace of Barilko or Hudson.


Eleven years later, on June 7, 1962, helicopter pilot Ron Boyd discovered the plane wreckage roughly 100 kilometres (62Â mi) north of Cochrane, Ontario, about 35 miles off-course. Barilko was finally buried in his home town of Timmins, the same year that the Maple Leafs won their next Stanley Cup.


In early press coverage of Fully Completely, Downie described the Barilko incident as ""an Amelia Earhart story, except everyone's heard of Amelia Earhart.""


The song's lyrics and title also reference a military cap, which became known as a 50 mission cap, and crush cap during World War II. The 'fifty mission cap' or 'crush cap' was just a standard issue military peaked cap, still widely used by modern military forces. These were worn by both fighter pilots and bomber crew. The term '50 mission cap' and 'crush cap' came from the look these caps gained after much wear. The wire crown stiffener was removed to allow the top of the hat to 'crush' so headphones could be worn in the cockpit. The aged and worn look of the cap was thus a status symbol, and according to Downie the intended theme in the lyrics was that a junior pilot would work their cap in to look like a fifty mission cap, ""so as to appear that you had more experience than you really did.""


The line ""I stole this from a hockey card"" references card #340 from the 1991 NHL Pro Set hockey card series, which tells the story of Bill Barilko.


The song's influence on public awareness of Barilko's story was such that the band is devoted an entire chapter in the 2004 book 67: The Maple Leafs, Their Sensational Victory, and the End of an Empire. The song remains a staple part of the warm-up playlist at every Maple Leafs home game, and the Leafs have a framed, handwritten copy of Gord Downie's lyrics to the song in their private players' lounge. Whenever the band played the Air Canada Centre, Barilko's retired-number banner was always left in place during the concert, and when Downie died on October 17, 2017, the team incorporated Barilko's banner into its Downie tribute.


In 2017, TSN aired the short documentary film The Mission, profiling a project to recover the remaining wreckage of Barilko's plane; the film took its title from ""Fifty Mission Cap"", and it thematically touched on the song's role in Barilko's story.

The book was released on July 1, 1999 by Pocket Books. It reached number 13 in the New York Times paperback bestsellers chart.


Rapp is introduced while he is performing a covert operation in Iran and he discovers a possible terrorist attack planned for the nation's capital to happen in the near future. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Anna Reilly is starting her first day as a White House correspondent for NBC. It also happens to be the day where the terrorist, using a secret entrance, takes over the White House and holds it hostage.  The president, who barely escaped the hostage situation, remains trapped in the unfinished bomb shelter. With the vice president using this opportunity as commander in chief to glorify his political career by being lenient towards the terrorist demands, Rapp must find a way to fight the terrorists from the inside of the White House. It is here where he saves Anna Reilly from being raped by one of the terrorists.


Several Navy SEALs sneak into the White House, eliminate the terrorists, and save the hostages and the president. The leader of the terrorist group manages to escape the White House while detonating his strategically placed explosives. He is later found in South America only to be killed by Rapp.

With the British occupation of Odisha in 1803, the management of the Jagannath Temple was taken over by the East India Company. From 1806 on wards the Temple was managed by a body headed by three Brahmins who are called Pundits locally. But later in 1809, the body was abolished and the management of the Temple was transferred to the then Raja of Khurdha (now known as the King of Puri). King Birakishore Dev was issue-less. After his death in 1859, his widow queen was authorized to manage the affairs of the temple as the adopted son was a minor. The period saw utter dislocation in the management of the temple. The management of the temple became deteriorated even after the king attained majority. So in 1885 the British filed a suit to takeover the management of the temple. The suit was hotly contested by the renowned lawyer of the time, Utkal Gourav Madhusudan Das and the suit was decreed in favour of the queen. As per the deed of compromise, the affairs of the temple was looked after by a competent manager till the grandson, Mukund Dev attained majority. Things did not improve even after Mukund Dev attained majority. So a Deputy Magistrate was appointed to manage the affairs of the temple during the lifetime of Mukund Dev. After the death of Mukund Dev, the management of the temple was transferred to Raja Ramachandra Dev. The king removed senior gazetted officers from the management of the temple for which the management of the temple continued to be deteriorated. During the period, India got independence and the Government of Orissa felt that some legislative measures are to be taken to restore the religious pride of the institution.


Foundation of a sound administrative system was laid down by Bhoi King Ramachandra Dev who declared himself as Gajapati Maharaja of Khurdha in 1571 CE. Since then his descendants has been looking after the affairs of the Temple as Thakura Rajas. After independence, the State Government, with a view to getting better administrative system,  passed The Puri Shri Jagannath Temple (Administration) Act, 1952. It contained provisions to prepare the Record of Rights and duties of Sevayats and such other persons connected with the system of worship and management of the temple. Subsequently, Shri Jagannath Temple Act - 1955 was enacted to reorganize the management system of the affair of the temple and its properties. The Act was brought into force with effect from 27.12.1960.


The enactment of the above Act was challenged by Gajapati Ramchandra Deva-IV claiming his entitlement over the temple and deity with the plea that as his forefathers had constructed and consecrated the temple and deity. Ultimately Hon'ble Supreme Court of India rejected the prayer of the king on 27 Oct, 1960. Hence Government of Orissa took over the charge of the Temple.


In terms of the provision of this Act, the management, administration and governance of the temple vests in a Committee known as Shri Jagannath Temple Managing Committee which consists of the followingÂ :


All sevaks, office-holders and servants attached to the Temple or in receipt of any emoluments or perquisites there from shall, whether such service is hereditary or not, be subjected to the control of the Administrator who may, subject to the provisions of this Act and the regulations, made by the Committee in that behalf, after giving the person concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard


Under this provision two of the Sevayats were suspended for the alleged delay in  Brahm paribartana during the Nabakalebara 2015.

Muckler had over 50 years of professional hockey experience as a part owner, general manager, director of player personnel, director of hockey operations, head coach, assistant coach and player. He had been a part of five Stanley Cup championships in various roles.


Born in Midland, Ontario in 1934, and raised in Paris, Ontario, Muckler was a defenceman in the minor leagues for 13 seasons, playing the bulk of his career in the Eastern Hockey League (EHL).


Muckler began his professional coaching career as a player/coach in 1959 with the EHL's New York Rovers. He then spent the next 20 years in off-ice positions with the New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars and Vancouver Canucks before joining the Edmonton Oilers organization in 1981. During those 20 years, Muckler served briefly as head coach of the North Stars in 1968â69, and won multiple regular-season titles, playoff championships and league coach-of-the-year honours in the minor leagues. For his successes, The Sporting News named him the top coach in minor-league hockey in 1979.


While with the Oilers, Muckler served as an assistant coach with the Stanley Cup winners under head coach/general manager Glen Sather in 1984 and 1985. After the 1984-85 season, Sather began splitting most coaching duties with Muckler, who was named assistant head coach. He won two more Cups in 1987 and 1988. When Sather relinquished his coaching duties in 1989, Muckler was promoted to head coach and led the club to its fifth Stanley Cup in seven years in 1990.


In 1991, Muckler left the Oilers organization and was hired by the Buffalo Sabres. Initially the club's director of hockey operations, he soon accepted the team's head coaching position and guided the Sabres for the next four seasons. He also assumed the role of Sabres' general manager in 1993. A finalist for the Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year in 1994, Muckler stepped down from coaching in 1995 to focus on his front-office duties and was named ""NHL Executive of the Year"" by The Sporting News for the 1996â97 season. Sabres President Larry Quinn fired Muckler in the 1997 offseason.


Muckler's last coaching position was as head coach of the New York Rangers from 1998 to 2000. His career coaching record is 276â288â84, combined with a 233â167â53â7 career record as an NHL general manager, and he has been involved in more than 2,000 professional games in varying roles. His rÃ©sumÃ© also includes three appearances at the National Hockey League All-Star Game and two appearances (1984 and 1987) on the coaching staff of the Canada Cup-winning Team Canada.


Muckler joined the Ottawa Senators as general manager in June 2002, and presided over what was arguably the team's most successful period. The team ultimately reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2007 but lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. Despite this success, the Senators announced that Muckler had been fired on June 18, 2007. Head coach Bryan Murray was promoted to replace him.


Muckler was hired as a senior advisor with the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes in September 2008.


In addition to his many years coaching and managing in the NHL, Muckler was also an assistant coach for the Canadian teams that won the 1984 and 1987 Canadian Cup tournaments.

2748709,Brick (film),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(film),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brick_(film)&action=info,"Brick is a 2005 American neo-noir mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson in his directorial debut, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Brick was distributed by Focus Features, and opened in New York and Los Angeles on April 7, 2006.


The film's narrative centers on a hardboiled detective story set in a California suburb. Most of the main characters are high school students. The film draws heavily in plot, characterization, and dialogue from hardboiled classics, especially those by Dashiell Hammett. The title refers to a block of heroin, compressed roughly to the size and shape of a brick.


The film won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and received positive reviews from critics. It has come to be regarded as a cult classic.


High school student Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) discovers a note directing him to a pay phone, where he receives a call from his ex-girlfriend Emily Kostich (Emilie de Ravin), begging him for help. She mentions a ""bad brick"", ""the Pin"", and ""Tug"" before abruptly hanging up, apparently afraid of a passing black Ford Mustang, from which a distinctively-branded cigarette is thrown. Unable to locate Emily, Brendan enlists his friend Brain (Matt O'Leary) for help. An encounter with another ex-girlfriend, Kara (Meagan Good), leads him to a party held by flirtatious upper-class girl Laura Dannon (Nora Zehetner) and her boyfriend, Brad Bramish (Brian J. White). Laura points Brendan to Dode (Noah Segan), Emily's drug-addicted new boyfriend, who arranges a meeting with Emily.


Emily dismisses the phone call as a mistake and tells Brendan to let her go. Brendan steals her notepad and finds a note that leads him to her dead body in a tunnel the following morning. Distraught, Brendan decides to investigate her murder, hiding the body to avoid police involvement. Brendan discovers that ""the Pin"" (Lukas Haas) refers to a secretive local drug baron. As Brad is a known drug user, Brendan picks a fight with him, hoping to attract the Pin's attention. Later, a man wearing a beanie attacks Brendan.


On his way home, Brendan sees the black Mustang in a parking lot and tries to break into it, but is caught by the beanie-wearing thug, who turns out to be the car owner. The man attacks Brendan, who repeatedly demands to meet the Pin instead of fighting back. The man is Tug (Noah Fleiss), the Pin's main enforcer, who reluctantly takes Brendan to the Pin's house. Brendan asks the Pin for a job, and the Pin says he will investigate Brendan and either hire him or have him hurt; Brendan will find out which by the next day. Laura reveals that she was at the Pin's house the entire time and drives Brendan back to school. She explains that Emily stole a ""brick"" of heroin after being rejected by the Pin's operation. Laura offers to help Brendan, but he distrusts her.


The next day, Brendan learns that the Pin has hired him. Dode calls Brendan and says he saw Brendan hide Emily's body. Believing Brendan is the murderer, he threatens to ruin him. Brendan meets the Pin, who suspects that Tug is planning to betray him. At the Pin's house, Tug tells Brendan that the Pin recently bought ten bricks of heroin. Eight were quickly sold off wholesale. The ninth was stolen and later returned contaminated, and the final brick remains to be sold. The Pin arrives and says that someone wants to meet to discuss Emily, revealing that Tug was also romantically involved with her.


Brendan intercepts Dode on the way to the meeting and discovers Emily was pregnant when she died; Dode believes the baby was his. Brendan passes out from his accumulated injuries and arrives at the meeting late to find Dode demanding money to reveal who killed Emily. Tug goes berserk and shoots Dode in the head, then threatens the Pin, who walks away as Brendan faints again. Brendan awakens in Tug's bedroom, and Tug tells him they are at war with the Pin.


Brendan arranges a meeting between the two and waits in Tug's bedroom. Laura comforts him as he grieves for Emily, and they kiss. Brendan recognizes her cigarette as the same brand that was dropped from the Mustang during the call with Emily. At the meeting, chaos erupts when it is discovered that the tenth brick is missing. Tug beats the Pin to death while Brendan flees, escaping just as police arrive. As he goes, he passes the partly-open trunk of Tug's car, where he has placed Emily's body to ensure that police blame her murder on Tug.


The next day, Brendan meets Laura at the school. Brendan explains that he knows Laura set Emily up to take the fall for Laura's theft of the ninth brick, then manipulated Emily into meeting Tug, who panicked and killed her after she told him he was the father of her unborn child. Brendan has written a note to the school administration stating that the tenth brick is in Laura's locker. Laura vindictively tells Brendan that Emily did not want to keep the baby because she did not love the father, and that Emily was three months pregnant when she died, meaning the unborn child was his.


The origins of Brick were Rian Johnson's obsessions with Dashiell Hammett's novels. Hammett was known for hardboiled detective novels, and Johnson wanted to make a straightforward American detective story. He had discovered Hammett's work through an interview of the Coen brothers about their 1990 gangster film, Miller's Crossing. He read Red Harvest (1929) and then moved on to The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The Glass Key (1931), the latter of which had been the main influence for the Coens' film. Johnson had grown up watching detective films and film noir. Reading Hammett's novels inspired him to make his own contribution. He realized that this would result in a mere imitation and set his piece in high school to keep things fresh. Of the initial writing process he remarked ""it was really amazing how all the archetypes from that detective world slid perfectly over the high school types"". He also wanted to disrupt the visual traditions that came from the genre. Once he started making Brick, he found it ""very much about the experience of being a teenager to me"". Johnson maintained that the film was not autobiographical.


Johnson wrote the first draft in 1997 after graduating from USC School of Cinematic Arts a year earlier. He spent the next seven years pitching his script, but no one was interested, because the material was too unusual to make with a first-time director. Johnson estimated the minimal amount of money for which he could make the film, and asked friends and family for backing. His family were in the construction industry, and contributed enough to encourage others to contribute. After Johnson had acquired about $450,000 for the film's budget, Brick began production in 2003.


Although the film was shot in 20 days, Johnson spent a great deal of time beforehand refining the script and three months rehearsing with the cast. He had seen Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a film called Manic (2001), met with him, and knew that he wanted to cast the young actor. He encouraged the cast to read Hammett but not to watch any noir films, because he did not want them influencing their performances. Instead, he had them watch Billy Wilder comedies like The Apartment (1960) and other comedies like His Girl Friday (1940). He was initially nervous working with a professional cast and crew for the first time but as soon as he started filming, this feeling went away and he had a good experience.


Johnson shot the film in his hometown of San Clemente, California on 35 mm film stock. Much of the film takes place at San Clemente High School, which he attended. He enlisted current students to work on the film, shooting on weekends. The cinematographer was Steve Yedlin, a film school friend who had been involved with the project since the script was written.


For the telephone booth scenes, Johnson and crew filmed deep in the San Clemente suburbia. The same sign for the cross streets of Sarmentoso and Camino del Rio still stands. However, the phone booth itself was a prop the production department added in for the film.


Coffee and Pie Oh My! was a Carrows restaurant, but it has since been abandoned.


The drain tunnel from the film is located just down the street from the San Clemente High School football field and goes under the freeway by the Pico exit off-ramp.


Johnson had difficulty finding a run-down house for the Pin's base of operations. The production found an appropriate house, but only had a week until it was demolished to rebuild on its lot. The basement was a set that they built, but the Pin's kitchen and living room still exists at the Blarney Castle bed and breakfast. Johnson also had difficulty finding a mansion for the party scene until, with one day left to find the location, a former Telecom executive and eccentric millionaire allowed them to shoot in his place which was still under construction. The big mansion was packed from floor to ceiling with pay phones dating back to the 1950s.


Johnson cited Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns and Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop (1998) as influences on his visualization of the film. He used shoes as a design element for his characters and saw them as an ""instant snapshot of the essence"" of the characters. He has also stated that many of the film's visual cues were taken from the neo-noir Chinatown (1974) with its wide-open flat spaces.


The majority of the film's special effects were cheaply and efficiently produced using practical and in-camera effects. Early in the film, for example, de Ravin walks toward the camera out of a tunnel as a garbage bag floats downstream and engulfs the camera, transitioning to Joseph Gordon-Levitt back in his character's bedroom. To achieve this, the desired effect was filmed in reverse order. The garbage bag began over the camera and was pulled away during filming, as de Ravin walked backwards into the tunnel. This footage was then cut into a scene in which a garbage bag was simply pulled over Gordon-Levitt's head.


Filming a car driving slowly in reverse, then playing the footage backwards at a higher speed gives the illusion of a car quickly approaching as the camera darts in front of it stylishly. Clever fades give the impression of time changes while smash cuts add tension to a scene in which the protagonist wakes up after passing out. Certain edits were also introduced to the film to time footage to different dialogue, adding certain information and leaving other information out. These edits are noticeable, as the actors' mouths are not always moving in sync with their dialogue. One particular scene, in which de Ravin's character floated toward the camera, used a green screen, but it was edited out of the film before its completion.


The original cut of the film ran over two hours, although it was edited down to 117 minutes for the Sundance Film Festival. An additional 7 minutes were cut before the theatrical release, including a shot of Zehetner's naked back as she put her shirt back on after she and Gordon-Levitt's character had sex. According to a post by Johnson on his own forums, he felt that the nudity felt wrong in the context of the film, and that he preferred to leave the degree of intimacy ambiguous, although he occasionally finds himself second-guessing that decision.


The score to Brick was composed by Johnson's cousin, Nathan Johnson, with additional support and music from The Cinematic Underground. The score harkens back to the style, feel and overall texture of noir films. It features traditional instruments such as the piano, trumpet and violin, and also contains unique and invented instruments such as the wine-o-phone, metallophone, tack pianos, filing cabinets, and kitchen utensils, all recorded with one microphone on an Apple PowerBook. Since Nathan Johnson was in England during most of the production process, the score was composed almost entirely over Apple iChat, with Rian playing clips of the movie for Nathan, who would then score them. The two met in New York City to mix the soundtrack. The soundtrack CD of the movie was released on March 12, 2006 by Lakeshore Records. In addition to Johnson's score, it contains songs by The Velvet Underground, Anton Karas and Kay Armen as well as the big band version of ""Frankie and Johnny"" performed by Bunny Berigan and a full unedited performance of ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze"" by Nora Zehetner. Johnson has confirmed that various elements in the film were influenced by Twin Peaks creator David Lynch.


The Region 1 DVD release of Brick was released on August 8, 2006 as part of the Focus Features Spotlight Series. Special features include: selection of deleted and extended scenes with introductions by Johnson; audition footage featuring Nora Zehetner and Noah Segan; and feature audio commentary with Rian Johnson, Nora Zehetner, Noah Segen, producer Ram Bergman, production designer Jodie Tillen, and costume designer Michele Posch.


The Region 2 DVD was released on September 18, 2006.


The Blu-ray for Brick was released on January 7, 2020 by Kino Lorber, which was supervised by Johnson and Yedlin. It was previously scheduled to be released on May 7, 2019.


Brick premiered in the United States on April 7, 2006, in two theaters. It opened to United Kingdom audiences on May 12, 2006 on a limited number of screens. According to the DVD commentary track, the film was made for just under $500,000. The film grossed US$2.07 million in North America and a total of $3.9 million worldwide.


Brick has an approval rating of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 142 reviews and an average score of 7.03/10. The consensus states: ""This entertaining homage to noirs past has been slickly and compellingly updated to a contemporary high school setting."" and ranked #35 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the ""50 Best High School Movies"". Based on 34 critic reviews, Metacritic gave it an average score of 72 out of 100, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".


Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, stating ""[It works] in the sense that the classic Hollywood noirs worked: The story is never clear while it unfolds, but it provides a rich source of dialogue, behavior and incidents."" The film's only serious flaw, thought Ebert, was that the characters were not entirely believable and thus it was difficult to care about the outcome of events for the characters. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film a positive review, explaining ""A spoof would have been easy. Instead, Johnson plunges off the deep end, risking ridicule by shaping this spellbinder with grit and gravitas.""


Stephen Holden of The New York Times commented, ""Mr. Haas and Mr. Gordon-Levitt at least succeed in evoking the outlines of their characters. But the film's ham-handed reliance on period argot not only wears thin; it keeps the characters, such as they are, at a chilly distance.""

""Green Shirt"" was not released as a single at the time of its 1979 release, but in 1985 it saw single release to promote The Man: The Best Of Elvis Costello. The single reached number 68 in Britain. Since its release, the song has been lauded by critics as one of Costello's best album tracks and has made several appearances in Costello's live setlist.


""Green Shirt"" was described by Elvis Costello as ""a paranoid song that I wrote ... about the simplification of seductive signals, the bedroom eyes that lead to tyranny"". The song was lyrically inspired by the Quisling Clinic, a building in Madison, Wisconsin that Costello reportedly saw and wrote down the name of while driving past. Costello later wrote that, while he had only ever associated the name ""Quisling"" with Norwegian fascist Vidkun Quisling, the combination of ""Quisling"" and ""Clinic"" had ""conjured up some kind of Boys from Brazil nightmare"". Costello also cited the rise of the National Front in Britain as inspiration.


The first recording of ""Green Shirt"" was an acoustic demo with alternate lyrics that would appear on later editions of This Year's Model. The final version of the song would ultimately appear on Costello's 1979 album Armed Forces. Costello recorded the vocals for ""Green Shirt"" after what he described as a ""late night of carousing"". This prevented him from raising his voice on the recording, much to the chagrin of producer Nick Lowe. Costello recalled,


I got no sympathy from Nick Lowe. He just pushed me into the vocal booth with a carton of cold orange juice, which I held against my brow rather than risk drinking it. It was hard to keep my voice from shaking with my pulse racing at my temples. I asked the control room for that awful juddering Minimoog and the rat-a-tat-a-tat of the snare drum to be turned down in my headphones. I was almost afraid of my own breath, but fear, of course, was the quality that song most required. 

""Green Shirt"" was first released on Costello's 1979 album Armed Forces. The song was not released as a single at the time. In 1985, the song was released as a single to promote the compilation album The Man: The Best Of Elvis Costello. The B-side was ""Beyond Belief"", a song from Costello's 1982 album Imperial Bedroom. The single was a moderate success in the UK, reaching number 68 on the charts. The release was accompanied by a newly created music video that featured clips from previous Elvis Costello music videos.


""Green Shirt"" has since been praised by critics as one of Costello's best album tracks. City Pages named the song one of Costello's 30 best deep cuts, praising the ""buoyant bounce underpinning some of Costello's darkest lyrics"" on the track. Tony Clayton-Lea of the Irish Times described the song as one of Costello's ""back-catalogue gems"" and praised the ""staccato backdrop"" and ""spooky vocal"". Paul Sexton of uDiscoverMusic called the track ""brooding"" and named it one of the highlights of Armed Forces, while Matt LeMay of Pitchfork called the song a ""near-classic"" that was ""hindered"" by the album's ""smoother production"".


""Green Shirt"" has become a mainstay of Costello's live setlist in recent years. Costello performed the song live at Heatwave in 1980, a performance which Paste Magazine described as ""taken at a faster clip than the ... studio recording"". Jacob Pucci of The Post-Standard described a live performance of the song at the Turning Stone Resort Casino from 2016 as ""energetic"" and ""synth-heavy"". Dave Mckenna of the Washington Post recalled that ""'Green Shirt' ... had some of the harder core fans singing along while throwing their arms skyward in deliriousness"" during a 2018 concert at the DAR Constitution Hall. At a 2018 show in Vancouver, Costello sardonically described ""Green Shirt"" as ""a song written last century"".

The Helsinki Finland Temple (Finnish: Helsingin temppeli, Swedish: Templet i Helsingfors) is the 124th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Unlike LDS chapels, where worship services are held and visitors are welcome, the temple is open only to church members.


Located at LeppÃ¤sillantie 3 in Espoo, the Helsinki Finland Temple has a total of 19,500 square feet (1,810Â m2), two ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms. It once served the geographically largest temple district of the church, which included Finland, the Baltic states, and all of Russia. It was the final temple dedicated during the presidency of Gordon B. Hinckley and the last dedicated by Hinckley.


The church's First Presidency announced on April 2, 2000 that a temple would be built near Helsinki in Espoo, Finland.


On March 29, 2003 a site dedication and groundbreaking ceremony were held in Karakallio, a district of Espoo. D. Lee Tobler, of the church's Second Quorum of the Seventy, presided at the ceremony and gave the site dedication prayer.


An open house was held September 21 to October 7, 2006 to allow the public to tour the temple prior to its dedication. The temple was dedicated on October 22, 2006 by Gordon B. Hinckley, after a cultural celebration was held the evening before.


In 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Helsinki Finland Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.",0,4 November 2006, 22 April 2021,93,0,0

46758881,Jim McWilliams,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McWilliams,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_McWilliams&action=info,"Jim McWilliams (born February 10, 1937) is an American artist and graphic designer who was active as an avant-garde performer and composer during the 1960s and 1970s.


McWilliams has been active as a graphic designer and maker of artist's books since 1962. That year, at the age of twenty-five, he took over the typography studio at the Philadelphia College of Art, which run until then by Eugene Feldman, founder of Falcon Press. As head of the studio, McWilliams collaborated on experimental book projects with the artist Claire Van Vliet, the founder of Janus Press and one of his colleagues at the school. He also assisted the avant-garde Swiss artist Dieter Roth with his exhibition and book Snow, which Roth realized in 1964 while in residence at the College. In 2015, McWilliams' own books were part of an exhibition at Northwestern University Library, which holds McWilliams's archives. The exhibition included early works such as The N Book (1965), a typographical deconstruction of the letter ""N,"" and later experiments such as Spiral Spiraling (1998), 600 pieces of die-cut paper that spiral around a metal rod.


As a teacher of art and design, McWilliams brought a new avant-garde sensibility to the College. According to art historian Sid Sachs, McWilliams ""radicalized"" the department through such tactics as opening his classes' Experimental Workshops to all students, regardless of major or grade point average. In an effort to increase attendance, he strove for a less hierarchical, more relaxed atmosphere, installing a pinball machine in his office and inviting go-go dancers into the typography studio every Friday afternoon.


In 1964, McWilliams began a series of concerts at the school that gave students the opportunity to hear work by such contemporary musicians and performances as Korean composer Nam June Paik and his collaborator, cellist Charlotte Moorman; Japanese composer Takehisa Kosugi; German happenings artist Wolf Vostell; the musician/composer team of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela; and minimalist composer Terry Riley. The events were sometimes controversial. Paik and Moorman's concert was almost stopped when Moorman began a striptease as part of Paik's Pop Sonata. Riley's first-ever all-night concert, conceived by McWilliams and performed with Young and Zazeela on November 17-18, 1967, raised fears of litigation among school administrators. McWilliams's idea was that people could bring their families and sleeping bags and spend the night at the gallery, but because the school had never been open overnight before, administrators required him to personally carry liability insurance for the event.


After moving to New York City in 1968, McWilliams expanded his design work to include clothing and interiors. Under the pseudonym Joe Millions, he designed a line of clothing for men and women in which he used cutaways to expose the body in unexpected ways. He also gained notice for the ""imaginative and provocative"" furnishings and decorative objects, made entirely of paper, with which he decorated his Manhattan apartment.


While teaching in Philadelphia, McWilliams expanded his artistic practice to include performance. Along with a group of his students, who were known as ""McWilliams's Pranksters,"" he became a well-known presence on the city's avant-garde scene. In 1968, in Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, he presented an event called A Balloon Dance for Children, in which he debuted his composition Sky Kiss, an attempt to levitate while hanging from a bunch of helium-filled balloons. He did not succeed. Charlotte Moorman accompanied him by playing a cello that was suspended from a second bunch of balloons.


In May 1967, McWilliams was invited to take part in The Museum of Merchandise, an exhibition of artist-designed furniture, fashion, and housewares held at the Philadelphia YMHA. Organized by local arts patrons Audrey Sabol and Joan Kron, the show featured perfume by Andy Warhol, light fixtures by James Rosenquist, a wastebasket by Arman, and ""enigmatic napkins"" by William T. Wiley, all available for purchase. Steve Reich was asked to compose music to set the mood for shoppers; he contributed a tape of artists chanting the phrase ""buy art."" McWilliams designed shopping bags, neckties, and buttons, and on opening night he directed a fashion show that featured a wedding gown created by the Hungarian artist Christo.


After 1966, McWilliams's artworks and performances were often realized in collaboration with Moorman. He composed numerous works for her, including Ice Music (1972), in which she used a file, a saw, a long strip of plexiglass, and other tools to play a cello made of ice until it melted; Candy (1973), in which she and her instrument were covered with chocolate fudge while seated in a gallery whose floor was covered with Easter grass and jelly beans; and C. Moorman in Drag (1973), in which she wore a tuxedo and Pablo Casals mask while miming a performance of a Bach suite for solo cello. During the 1970s, the pieces he wrote for her became increasingly spectacular. In A Water Cello for Charlotte Moorman (1972), she and her cello were submerged in a tank of water pumped in from the Hudson River. Flying Cello (1974) had Moorman attempt to make contact with her cello as they swung on separate trapezes, and in Cambridge Special for Charlotte, Elephant, and Cello (1978) she rode through the streets of Cambridge on the back of an elephant while dressed as Cleopatra. In 2001, the cellist Joan Jeanrenaud, formerly of the Kronos Quartet, revived Ice Music for performances at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.


One of Moorman's best-known works was McWilliams's Sky Kiss, the piece he had written for himself in 1968. After realizing that it suited Moorman's abilities better than his own, he gave the piece to her, along with the parachute harness he had used to attach himself to the balloons. Later performances of the piece were done over the Sydney Opera House, the Danube River, and the Mojave Desert, among others.


McWilliams was a regular contributor to Moorman's Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York (1963-1980), a series of fifteen events that presented experimental art, music, and performance. In 1966, he took part in the 4th festival, held in Manhattan's Central Park, with a work entitled American Picnic, an audience participation piece that addressed the issue of overconsumption. For the 1967 festival, held aboard a Staten Island ferry boat, he and a group of students dressed in wet suits, headlamps, and red face paint slithered along the boat's deck in a work called Slow Dance on the Ferry. For the 1977 festival, he installed Meandering Yellow Line in the World Trade Center's north tower: a vertical necklace of blinking yellow lights installed in a window on each of the tower's 107 floors.


Beginning in 1966, McWilliams was the official graphic designer for Moorman's festival. He designed twelve of the fifteen festival posters; their distinctive, highly original graphics were effective in reinforcing the avant-garde nature of the events. The posters are in the collections of numerous public and private institutions, including the Walker Art Center, the Fondazione Bonotto, and the Getty Research Institute.",2,20 May 2015, 10 April 2021,106,0,0

The Fibonacci sequence consists of numbers that are the summation of the two preceding numbers, starting with [0, 1]. Agile uses the Fibonacci sequence to achieve better results by reducing complexity, effort, and doubt when determining the development time required for a task, which can range from a few minutes to several weeks.


It is easier to determine the relative complexity of a task rather than figuring out how much time it requires. Due to this, when working with agile, a revised Fibonacci scale is used in terms of points to estimate the work, as opposed to the traditional measurement of time.


In one method commonly used to calculate the size of stories in points, a process like the game of Planning Poker, the following process is used:         


Giving each member the opportunity to think individually reduces pressure and may result in a more accurate representation of the featureâs size. 


In another commonly used method, a process like the game of Two Pass Relative Sizing, also known as the Steve Bockman Method and the Team Estimation Game, the following process is used:


This method has the advantages that numbers are not used until the second pass; that no guessing is required for the first story read as to how big a ""5"" or ""8"" or ""3"" is; that stories are truly ordered and numbered relative to each other; and when not everyone can estimate the entire story.


Regardless of method, as the team goes through multiple sprints and the estimation process is improved, the product manager will be able to determine a stable velocity. The velocity is determined by calculating the number of story points completed in each iteration.


People estimate user stories with smaller points more accurately than user stories that have higher costs associated with them. As the numbers increase, the difference between two succeeding numbers increases exponentially and leads to less accurate estimates.


One good way to estimate the cost is to express it in terms of multiples of other known user stories' costs. This way, it will be easier for each team member to estimate the relative cost. The estimation process of comparing a story with two previously estimated user stories is called triangulation.


The product manager can include a ""0"" value in the scale indicating that the user stories need very little time or resources. However, the user story that was assigned 0 cost cannot be used as a relative scale to estimate the cost of other user stories (i.e. we cannot say a story is 10 times harder than a story of size 0).


An advantage of Fibonacci sequence is that it allows developers to disaggregate a user story from one large bucket into two preceding buckets (since a bucket is formed by adding the size of two preceding buckets). This process helps to create optimal user stories.",0,21 January 2017, 7 February 2021,50,0,0

Its common name is slender-horned spineflower. This is a small annual plant forming a patch of spreading basal leaves a few centimeters in diameter, or slightly larger when more moisture is available. It bolts an erect stalk upon which it bears inflorescences of flowers. Each group of white or pink flowers is enclosed in a tiny cup of fused bracts which is only a few millimeters wide. The fruit is a dark achene about 2 millimeters long.


This plant grows in the silt-rich floodplains and washes of the foothills of the Transverse Ranges and the Peninsular Ranges of southern California. It is known from fewer than 40 reported sightings, many of which were in locations that have since been claimed for development or otherwise altered. About 19 occurrences are believed to exist now. This plant has been recorded in only a few general areas, including Tujunga Wash and the floodlands surrounding the Santa Ana and San Jacinto Rivers. The main threats to this species include water diversion, off-road vehicles, invasive species of plants, and development on the private property where most occurrences of this plant are located.",2,28 November 2007, 21 March 2021,23,0,0

The area was first made known as a rich alluvial gold field and was mined extensively in the 1860s.


Its uniquely warm, dry climate earned it the name 'The heart of the desert', as climatic conditions and human activity have combined to strip the area of most of the original native vegetation leaving rocks, sands and soils exposed. Today, these climate conditions make Bannockburn the home of many vineyards and stonefruit orchards.


The plans for the settlement began in 1862, as a result of miners being forced upstream from rising water levels in the Clutha and Kawarau Rivers. Though the area was settled around this period, the population was not stationary. As miners followed gold up the creeks, the settlements tended to follow, and by 1868 the original settlement had been strung out along what is now the Bannockburn-Nevis road. As miners swept over the area, from 1862 to 1871 the face of the landscape underwent drastic changes as the alluvial flat was washed away by sluicing operations to the foreboding landscape that exists today.  Water during this period was a pivotal resource, not just for mining but to supply the town as well. Evidence of the complex water system that once existed is spread throughout the landscape. Multiple dams, (technically reservoirs) feed a water system that extends from high on the nearby Carrick range down to the abandoned sluicing sites. Tippet's Dam was one of, if not the largest of these reservoirs. The water has since been redirected for horticultural and viticultural use and the sluicings rest dormant on land belonging to the Department of Conservation.


Wine in this region, like the majority of Central Otago, focuses primarily on Pinot noir, suited to the dry climate and soils. The climate of Bannockburn epitomizes that of the Central Otago wine region and claims some of the highest temperatures and lowest rainfall in the area. The area is limited by geographical constraints to relatively small outputs, and most of the vineyards boast a boutique high quality wine with typically small volumes of grapes. Several internationally renowned vineyards exist within a small radius producing wine that is distributed often to an international base.  Akarua, Bannock Brae, Felton Road, Mt. Difficulty and Terra Sancta are among a few of the internationally known wineries in this area.",10,25 August 2010, 28 March 2021,37,0,0

138016,"Maple Valley, Washington","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Valley,_Washington","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maple_Valley,_Washington&action=info","Maple Valley is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 22,684 at the 2010 census, and is estimated to be 27,202 as of 2019. The city functions as a commuter town for residents, though there is an increasing amount of commercial activity in the area.


The area was settled in 1879 by three men who were improving a trail and brought their families in. When a name for a future community was proposed, the names Vine Maple Valley and Maple Ridge were suggested. A vote was taken by writing the names on slips of paper and placing them in a hat. Vine Maple Valley won by 2/3, but the word ""Vine"" was later cut by the post office because it made the name too long.


The town's early history mainly had to do with coal, lumber milling to build homes, and a railroad that ran through town. Coal was brought in from Black Diamond to the south, but the town itself also mined coal from Cedar Mountain. The mine was used as late as 1947.
Rail workers for lines like the Northern Pacific Railroad and the Cedar River Watershed, closed off by the City of Seattle, meant more workers for those things. More residents meant more lumber milling. More lumber milling meant more workers. Suquamish tribe chairperson Martha George was born near Maple Valley in Sheridan in 1892, at a logging camp where her mother and grandmother worked as cooks.""


The town grew inward. Blacksmith shops, hotels, saloons and stores took up the town in the 1910s and 1920s. Schools went up as well. Early schools were shacks at best. A two-room school went up in 1910, and a larger high school was built in 1929 as the first school in the Tahoma School District. The school, after extensive renovations, still stands today as an elementary school. Much of this early development actually did not take place in the modern-day city, but rather in Hobart, northeast of incorporated Maple Valley.


More residents meant farming and fishing became staples in the area, with milk, poultry and berry farming becoming the main grown food staples in the area. Fishing out of the Cedar River also became popular. Maple Valley also saw resorts beginning in the 1920s. Lake Wilderness, once the site of a county lumber mill, quickly became a resort lake with the opening of Gaffney's Grove, which opened with a ballroom, restaurant and roller rink. Later, the resort grew to include an airstrip, lodge, rental cabins, a nine-hole golf course and a bowling alley. It remained in operation until 1964.


Increasing automobile use in the area gave rise to new roads being built. In the early 1960s, the construction of State Route 18 between Auburn and North Bend ran through the city, requiring many landmarks to be either demolished or moved. The Maple Valley Historical Society keeps records on the city's past, with two historical museums holding artifacts such as the city's first fire engine and photographs of old places in and around the city like Gaffney's Grove.[citation needed]


The city of Maple Valley was officially incorporated on August 31, 1997. The Green to Cedar River trail runs through the city, along SR 169 and Witte Road while passing through the former Gaffney's Grove site, now the Lake Wilderness City Park. The park includes a swimming beach and sprawling grass fields, and sees the annual Maple Valley Days Parade each year in June. The Lake Wilderness Arboretum is also located here.[citation needed]


Due to the urban growth boundaries of King County, the city is uniquely split into different sectors along Maple Valley Highway (SR 169), the main thoroughfare through the city. At the northern and southern boundaries of the city lie two large commercial areas, while central Maple Valley is predominantly residential.[citation needed]


The south side's Four Corners district is the main commercial area of the city. It is located along Maple Valley Highway and is bisected by Kent-Kangley Road (SR 516) to create four distinct areas of development. The northwestern corner underwent massive reconstruction in the early 2010s and now features several large retailers, apartments, and a strip mall. The northeastern corner was completely constructed in the 2010s; it formerly was a large lumberyard and is now home to several retailers. The southern corners feature strip malls, retailers, an apartment complex, and a housing development.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.90 square miles (15.28Â km2), of which, 5.72 square miles (14.81Â km2) is land and 0.18 square miles (0.47Â km2) is water.


The main bodies of water in the city limits are Lake Wilderness, Lake Lucerne, Rock Creek, and part of Pipe Lake. The Cedar River passes through unincorporated King County very near the northeastern border of the city. The city is bordered by Hobart, Fairwood, and Ravensdale, two unincorporated King County census-designated places, along with the cities of Renton, Kent, and Black Diamond.

The entirety of Maple Valley is served by the Tahoma School District. There is one high school, two middle schools, and six elementary schools. The district operates its transportation facility adjacent to SR 18 on Petrovitsky near the city limits. The Central Services building is located next to Rock Creek Elementary School.


The Tahoma School District at one point had its high school in neighboring Covington. In 2015, a bond measure was passed to build a new and more centralized high school for the district. It was to be built in a small unincorporated area southeast of Four Corners that was completely surrounded by Maple Valley, known informally as the âDonut Holeâ. The area was annexed into Maple Valley and the new three-story Tahoma High School was completed in 2017.


Most of the district's schools are located within the city, with a few exceptions:


The City Council is made up of seven councillors elected by local residents.


According to the city's website, ""the Council establishes policy direction for the City, enacts ordinances and resolutions, maintains relationships and contact in local, state, regional and national associations, and generally provides leadership for the City and direction to the City Manager.""

251196,Twistor memory,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_memory,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twistor_memory&action=info,"Twistor memory is a form of computer memory formed by wrapping magnetic tape around a current-carrying wire. Operationally, twistor was very similar to core memory. Twistor could also be used to make ROM memories, including a re-programmable form known as piggyback twistor. Both forms were able to be manufactured using automated processes, which was expected to lead to much lower production costs than core-based systems.


Introduced by Bell Labs in 1957, the first commercial use was in their 1ESS switch which went into operation in 1965. Twistor was used only briefly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when semiconductor memory devices replaced almost all earlier memory systems. The basic ideas behind twistor also led to the development of bubble memory, although this had a similarly short commercial lifespan.


In core memory, small ring-shaped magnets - the cores - are threaded by two crossed wires, X and Y, to make a matrix known as a plane. When one X and one Y wire are powered, a magnetic field is generated at a 45-degree angle to the wires. The core magnets sit on the wires at a 45-degree angle, so the single core wrapped around the crossing point of the powered X and Y wires will be affected by the induced field.


The materials used for the core magnets were specially chosen to have a very ""square"" magnetic hysteresis pattern. This meant that fields just below a certain threshold will do nothing, but those just above this threshold will cause the core to be affected by that magnetic field. The square pattern and sharp flipping states ensures that a single core can be addressed within a grid; nearby cores will see a slightly different field, and not be affected.


The basic operation in a core memory is writing. This is accomplished by powering a selected X and Y wire both to the current level that will, by itself, create Â½ the critical magnetic field. This will cause the field at the crossing point to be greater than the core's saturation point, and the core will pick up the external field. Ones and zeros are represented by the direction of the field, which can be set simply by changing the direction of the current flow in one of the two wires.


In core memory, a third wire - the sense/inhibit line - is needed to write or read a bit. Reading uses the process of writing; the X and Y lines are powered in the same fashion that they would be to write a ""0"" to the selected core. If that core held a ""1"" at that time, a short pulse of electricity is induced into the sense/inhibit line. If no pulse is seen, the core held a ""0"". This process is destructive; if the core did hold a ""1"", that pattern is destroyed during the read, and has to be re-set in a subsequent operation.


The sense/inhibit line is shared by all of the cores in a particular plane, meaning that only one bit can be read (or written) at once. Core planes were typically stacked in order to store one bit of a word per plane, and a word could be read or written in a single operation by working all of the planes at once.


Between reads or writes the data was stored magnetically. This means that core is a non-volatile memory.


Manufacturing core was a major issue. The X and Y wires had to be threaded through the cores in a weave pattern, and the sense/inhibit line passed through every core in a plane. In spite of considerable effort, no one successfully automated the production of core,[citation needed] which remained a manual task into the 1970s. To increase memory density one had to use smaller cores, which greatly increased the difficulty of wiring them onto the lines. Although the density of core increased many times over its operational lifetime, the per-bit cost of core remained steady.


An early iteration of the Twistor comprised a twisted ferromagnetic wire threaded through a series of concentric solenoids (see attached photo of a test rig for a single ""bit""). The longer solenoid is the SENSE coil, the shorter one the WRITE coil. A single bit was written by pulsing the WRITE coil with a + (1) or - (0) current sufficient to magnetize the helical area beneath the coil in one of two directions. At one end of the stretched wire was the READ solenoid - when pulsed it sent an acoustic wave through the wire. As the acoustic pulse passed under each SENSE coil it induced a small electrical pulse, either + or - depending on the direction of magnetization of the region of the wire. Thus with each pulse a ""byte"" could be read out serially. 


Twistor was similar in concept to core memory, but replaced the circular magnets with magnetic tape to store the patterns. The tape was wrapped around one set of the wires, the equivalent of the X line, in such a way that it formed a 45-degree helix. The Y wires were replaced by solenoids wrapping a number of twistor wires. Selection of a particular bit was the same as in core, with one X and Y line being powered, generating a field at 45 degrees. The magnetic tape was specifically selected to only allow magnetization along the length of the tape, so only a single point of the twistor would have the right direction of field to become magnetized.


The original twistor system used permalloy tape wrapped around a 3 mil copper wire. For any given length of wire, the tape was wound up over only the first half. The copper wire was then bent at the point where the tape ended, and ran back alongside the portion with the tape, forming a return conductor. This meant all the connections were at one end. Several such twistor lines were laid side-by-side and then laminated into a PET film plastic sheet, with the twistors and their return wires about 1/10th of an inch apart. A typical tape might have five twistor wires and their returns, so the sheet was just over an inch wide. The solenoid was similarly constructed, consisting of a number of 0.15 inch wide copper tapes laminated into a plastic tape of the same basic dimensions as the twistor. Unlike a traditional solenoid with many turns of wire around an open core, this system was essentially nothing more than single wires in a sheet of plastic.


To build the complete memory system, a sheet of the solenoid was laid out flat, say along the X direction, and then a sheet of the twistor was laid on top at right angles to it along the Y axis. The solenoid tape was then folded over, so that it wrapped the twistor sheet, producing a series of U-shaped solenoids. Now another layer of the solenoid tape is laid over the first, the twistor tape folded over so it now runs along the negative Y axis across the top of the new solenoid tape, and then the solenoid tape is folded over to form a second set of loops. This process continues until the twistor strip is ""used up"", forming a compact cube of memory. Along one side of the memory, connected to each of the solenoid loops, was a series of small cores used solely for switching (their original purpose, development as a memory came later).


The main reason for Bell's development of twistor is that the process could be highly automated. Although the folding process that completed the twistor might be carried out by hand, the layup and laminating of the sheets was easily handled by machine. Improved versions of twistor also wrapped the section of bare copper initially used solely for the return path, thereby doubling density without any changes to the production techniques.


Writing to twistor was effectively identical to core; a particular bit was selected by powering one of the twistor wires and one of the solenoid loops to one half of the required power, such that the required field strength was created only at the intersection of the two.


Reading used a different process. Unlike core, twistor did not have a sense/inhibit line. Instead, it used a larger current in the solenoid, large enough to flip all of the bits in that loop, and then used the twistor wires as the read line.


Twistor was thus read and written one plane at a time, rather than in core, where only one bit per plane could be used at once.


Twistor could be modified to produce a ROM that could be easily re-programmed. To do this, one-half of each solenoid loop was replaced with an aluminum card into which tiny vicalloy bar magnets were embedded. As the solenoids have to be complete circuits in order for current to flow through them, they were still inserted as folded sheets, but in this case the loop was inserted between the folds of twistor instead of around them. This allowed the single sheet to act as one half of a solenoid loop for two folds of the twistor, above and below. To complete the loop, the card of magnets was placed on the other side of the twistor tape.


Reads were performed by powering the solenoid to a point about half of that needed to produce a write. This field was ""reflected"" by the aluminum sheet, closing the loop, magnetically. The resulting field was greater than the write strength, causing the permalloy state to flip. If the bit was beside an unmagnetized bar magnet in the card, the field was not opposed and the flip caused a current pulse in the twistor wire, reading a ""1"". However, by magnetizing the bar at that bit, the bar magnet opposed the field being created by the solenoid current, causing it to be below the write strength, and preventing the flip. This read a ""0"".


The permanent magnet twistor (PMT) was re-programmed by removing the plates and placing them over a custom writer. Vicalloy was used because it required much more power to re-magnetize than the permalloy tape, so that the system would never come close to re-setting the permanent magnets while in use in the memory system. The writer system used much larger currents that overcame this resistance.


The PMT that was used in the 1ESS system used modules with 128 cards with 2818 magnets (for 64 44-bit words) on each. This produced a module with 8192 words (8 kibiwords). The complete store used 16 modules for a total of 131,072 words (128 kibiwords), equivalent to 720,896 8-bit bytes (704 KiB).


Another form of twistor ROM replaced the permanent magnet cards with a second magnetic tape wrapped around the first on the twistor lines, in a ""piggyback"" configuration. This tape was coated with coballoy instead of permalloy, which is much ""harder"" magnetically, requiring about twice the field in order to flip. To make the system even harder, the coballoy tape was about two and a half times thicker than the permalloy one, so the resulting field strength was five times. The external current required to flip the state of the coballoy tape was about 15 times that of the normal operational current.


Read operations in the piggyback are identical to the permanent magnet version. Writes were slightly more complex, due to the fact that piggyback twistors all featured the magnetic tape along the entire length of the X wire. This meant that any one solenoid was wrapping both the bit that is being written as well as the one on the section of return wire. To set the one both and not the other, the solenoid was first powered in one direction and then the other, while the current in the twistor line remained constant. This created two magnetic fields in turn, one aligned with the first section of wire and then the second. All reads and writes were carried out on paired bits in this fashion.


Twistor was used in a number of applications. Much of the development funding was supplied by the US Air Force, as twistor was to be used as the main memory in the LIM-49 Nike Zeus project.


In the United States the Bell System (American Telephone & Telegraph) also used twistors with permanent magnets as the ""Program Store"" or main memory in their first electronic telephone switching system, the 1ESS as well as others in the ESS series of electronic telephone switches, and did so up to the 4ESS switch introduced in 1976 and sold into the 1980s.


In addition, twistor was used in the Traffic Service Position System (TSPS), Bell's successor to cord telephone switchboards which controlled call handling and coin collection for local and international calls.


As of October, 2008 some remaining TSPS and ESS installations continue to provide telephone service in rural areas of the United States, as well as Mexico and Colombia where many U.S. systems were sold and re-installed after being removed from service in the United States.",2,22 June 2003, 10 July 2021,93,0,0

It was set up in the 1980s by the Chinese government to function as the largest investment bank in Central China.[citation needed]


Strategically located in Wuhan, the largest city in Central China and the fifth largest in China, WITIC's main goal was to attract foreign investments for the heavily industrial cities in the area. With much autonomy, but still under the supervision of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation in Beijing (CITIC), WITIC brought major foreign investments to Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation  and Dongfeng Motor Corporation.[citation needed] WITIC survived the crash of Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp. (GITIC) in 1998  and severe liquidity problem that followed, which bankrupted most of the ITICs in China. However, in the light of the more decentralized approach by the Chinese government, WITIC has in recent years broken up into several companies that specialize in brokerage, investment, and accounting.[citation needed]",2,9 December 2008, 9 May 2020,37,0,0

The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.


In the autumn of 1850, the meeting was held to organize a Christian school and a place for worship by the first Norwegian immigrant settlers to the Paint Creek area of Allamakee County. The school was organized in March the following year with Ole Larson as the first teacher. The first church services were held in July in the home of Thomas Anderson by Pastor Claus Lauritz Clausen from Rock County, Wisconsin. The schoolhouse was completed by November 1851 and was used for church services as well.


Initially, the congregation had only visiting ministers. They sent a Letter of Call to Norway for their own pastor. It was answered by the Rev. U. V. Koren, who arrived in late 1853 and stayed until 1862 when he returned to Norway. All of East Paint Creek's early pastors were from Norway. In July 1855 it was decided to build a log structure for a church, which was completed in 1857. The congregation grew in size and divided into two separate churches, East Paint Creek Church and West Paint Creek Church, because of the poor roads in the area.


The cornerstone for the present church was laid on May 24, 1869, and the church was dedicated on August 24, 1870. W.A. Eriksen constructed the Gothic Revival style building. The Rev. Ove Jacob Hjort (1827â1879) was the pastor at the time. A cemetery, which pre-dates it, surrounds the church building. Services were conducted in Norwegian, at least partially, into the 1930s.


In 1880, a controversy over predestination erupted among Norwegian Lutherans which affected the congregations in the Paint Creek area. A small group broke away from the original churches and became known as the East and West Synod Lutheran Churches. To distinguish between the two groups, the original churches were renamed Old East Paint Creek Church and Old West Paint Creek Church. Old East Paint remained in the ""anti-Missouri"" synod of the church until 1890, when they affiliated with the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. Another split in the congregation occurred in 1907 that resulted in the establishment of the Waterville Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 1917, Old East Paint Church changed its affiliation to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The congregation has now moved to the town of Waukon, Iowa, as King of Grace Lutheran Church and the old church building is unused.


The main church follows a rectangular plan, measuring 64 by 44 feet (20 by 13Â m). The exterior is composed of locally quarried limestone covered with stucco. The projecting central pavilion is capped with a frame bell chamber and spire that rises to a height of 100 feet (30Â m). The main entrance, also located in the central pavilion, is located within an elliptical arch that is framed by a Gothic portico. The side elevations feature five lancet windows that are symmetrically placed.


A vestry was added later to the rear of the church sanctuary. Its exterior is also composed of limestone that is laid in random coursed ashlar without a stucco covering. It may indicate the appearance of the main church without the stucco. A new basement and foundation were built beneath the church and vestry from 1949 to 1952. Matching additions with shed roofs were built on each side of the vestry in 1967.


The interior features its original wooden altar, pulpit, baptismal font, pews, altar rail, and a two-tier brass chandelier. The stained glass windows date from 1957. The original balcony stairs were replaced in 1970. The sanctuary interior is capped with a pressed tin ceiling.",0,6 December 2010, 18 May 2021,32,0,0

It is located within the Makalu-Barun National Park.


North of Kyashar lies the Kangtega (6783 m), southwest the Kusum Kangguru (6367 m), and the Mera Peak (6476 m) is 6.77 km southeast.


The Kyashar is connected to the Kantega via a ridge. On the west flank flows the Kyashar glacier.


Until 1983, the mountain was named ""Peak 43"". This year, the Nepalese authorities carried out a naming of mountains and other geographic locations, to ""wipe out"" a large number of Western names from the map. From 1983 the mountain is Kyashar. The mountain also has a third name, Thangnaktse. At a local level it also appears the name Charpate, which means ""square"", which is a good description of the shape of mountain peak.


The Kyashar was first climbed on 18 October 2003 by Bruce Normand, Andreas Frank and Sam Broderick. The ascent route led over the west ridge and the west wall.


On November 11, 2012, the Japanese Yasuhiro Hanatani, Hiroyoshi Manome and Tatsuya Aoki made the first ascent of the mountain over the south pillar (South Pillar), the so-called NIMA route (2400m, ED +, 5.10a, M5), in alpine style, for what they were awarded the Piolet d'Or.",0,22 November 2017, 27 April 2020,26,0,0

The TreviglioâBergamo railway is a railway line in Lombardy, Italy. The railway infrastructure is managed by the Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, which classifies it as one of its complementary lines. The passenger service is operated by Trenord as a regional service.


The line was planned in the last years of the Austrian domination of Lombardy, and opened in 1857 before the Second Italian War of Independence.


It was electrified in 1954.",1,11 October 2019, 21 August 2020,4,0,0
1952649,168th Street station (New York City Subway),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/168th_Street_station_(New_York_City_Subway),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=168th_Street_station_(New_York_City_Subway)&action=info,"168th Street (formerly Washington Heightsâ168th Street) is an underground New York City Subway station complex shared by the IRT BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line. It is located at the intersection of 168th Street and Broadway in Washington Heights, Manhattan and served by the 1 and A trains at all times, and the C train at all times except late nights.


The BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line station was built for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), and was a station on the West Side Branch of the city's first subway line, which was approved in 1900. The station opened on April 14, 1906. The Eighth Avenue Line station was built as an express and terminal station for the Independent Subway System (IND) and opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the IND's first segment.


The IRT station has two side platforms and two tracks. The IND station has two island platforms and four tracks, although the track configuration is reversed from most New York City Subway express stations, with express trains using the outer tracks and local trains using the inner tracks. The transfer between the IRT platforms and the IND platforms has been within fare control since July 1, 1948. The IND station contains elevators, which make it compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). While the IRT station can only be reached by elevators, it is not ADA-accessible. The IRT station's interior is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.


The IRT BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line stations are connected by a passageway, which was placed inside fare control on July 1, 1948.


Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864.:â21â However, development of what would become the city's first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature authorized the Rapid Transit Act.:â139â140â The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, chief engineer of the Rapid Transit Commission. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx.:â3â A plan was formally adopted in 1897,:â148â and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899.:â161â


The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line.:â165â In 1901, the firm of Heins & LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations.:â4â Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.:â182â


The 168th Street station was constructed as part of the IRT's West Side Line (now the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line) from 133rd Street to a point 100 feet (30 m) north of 182nd Street. Work on this section was conducted by L. B. McCabe & Brother, who started building the tunnel segment on May 14, 1900.


The original New York City Subway line from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch opened in 1904,:â186â:â189â with the line being extended to 157th Street that year.:â191â The West Side Branch was extended northward from 157th Street to a temporary terminus at 221st Street, near the Harlem River Ship Canal,[a] on March 12, 1906, with the station at 168th Street not yet open. This extension was initially served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. The 168th Street station opened for service on April 14, 1906. On May 30, 1906, express trains began running through to 221st Street. The opening of the first subway line, and particularly the 168th Street station, helped contribute to the development of Washington Heights.:â9â


After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by West Side local and express trains. Express trains began at South Ferry in Manhattan or Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, and ended at 242nd Street in the Bronx. Local trains ran from City Hall to 242nd Street during rush hours, continuing south from City Hall to South Ferry at other times. In 1918, the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line opened south of Times Squareâ42nd Street, thereby dividing the original line into an ""H""-shaped system. The original subway north of Times Square thus became part of the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line. Local trains were sent to South Ferry, while express trains used the new Clark Street Tunnel to Brooklyn.


In Fiscal Year 1909, work was done to increase the carrying load of the elevators at the station. To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening platforms at stations along the original IRT subway.:â168â As part of a modification to the IRT's construction contracts, made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $41.7 million in 2020) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $13,888,000 in 2020) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent.:â15â The northbound platform at the 168th Street station was extended 179 feet (55Â m) to the south. The arched ceiling adjacent to the platform extension was replaced with a flat roof made of steel beams, since the arch's structural integrity was compromised by the platform extension.:â113â The southbound platform was not lengthened.:â106â On January 24, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the West Side Line.:â168â Subsequently, the station could accommodate six-car local trains, but ten-car trains could not open some of their doors.


In Fiscal Year 1923, work began on the installation of a new entrance with elevators on the west side of Broadway to increase the capacity of the station. In Fiscal Year 1924, work to construct new entrances to the station was 87 percent complete, and two new elevators were installed.


Platforms at IRT BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line stations between 103rd Street and 238th Street, including those at 168th Street, were lengthened to 514 feet (157Â m) between 1946 and 1948, allowing full ten-car express trains to stop at these stations. A contract for the platform extensions at 168th Street and eight other stations on the line was awarded to Spencer, White & Prentis Inc. in October 1946. The platform extensions at these stations were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, including this station but excluding 125th Street. Simultaneously, the IRT routes were given numbered designations with the introduction of ""R-type"" rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The first such fleet, the R12, was put into service in 1948. The route to 242nd Street became known as the 1. In 1959, all 1 trains became local.


On December 28, 1950, the New York City Board of Transportation issued a report concerning the construction of bomb shelters in the subway system. Five deep stations in Washington Heights, including the 168th Street station, were considered to be ideal for being used as bomb-proof shelters. The program was expected to cost $104 million (equivalent to $1,118.7 million in 2020). These shelters were expected to provide limited protection against conventional bombs, while providing protection against shock waves and air blast, as well as from the heat and radiation from an atomic bomb. To become suitable as shelters, the stations would require water-supply facilities, first-aid rooms, and additional bathrooms. However, the program, which required federal funding, was never completed. In Fiscal Year 1958, two elevators at the station were replaced with automatic ones. In Fiscal Year 1961, the installation of fluorescent lighting at the station was completed.


In April 1988, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) unveiled plans to speed up service on the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line through the implementation of a skip-stop service: the 9 train. When skip-stop service started in 1989, it was only implemented north of 137th StreetâCity College on weekdays, and 168th Street was served by both the 1 and the 9. Skip-stop service ended on May 27, 2005.


Between July 5 and September 8, 1997, trains did not stop at the station while the elevators were modernized. The project cost $4 million (equivalent to $6.4 million in 2020). A shuttle bus service was provided to 181st Street on the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line.


In July 2003, to reduce costs, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) announced that as part of its 2004 budget it would eliminate 22 elevator operator positions at this station and four others in Washington Heights, leaving one full-time operator per station. The agency had intended removing all the attendants at these stops, but kept one in each station after many riders protested. The change took effect on January 20, 2004 and saved $1.2Â million a year. In November 2007, the MTA proposed savings cuts to help reduce the agency's deficit. As part of the plan, all elevator operators at 168th Street, along with those in four other stations in Washington Heights, would have been cut. MTA employees had joined riders in worrying about an increase in crime as a result of the cuts after an elevator operator at 181st Street on the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line helped save a stabbed passenger. The move was intended to save $1.7 million a year. However, on December 7, 2007, the MTA announced that it would not remove the remaining elevator operators at these stations, due to pushback from elected officials and residents from the area. In October 2018, the MTA once again proposed removing the elevator operators at the five stations, but this was reversed after dissent from the Transport Workers' Union.


The elevator attendants serve as a way to reassure passengers as the elevators are the only entrance to the platforms, and passengers often wait for the elevators with an attendant. The attendants at the five stations are primarily maintenance and cleaning workers who suffered injuries that made it hard for them to continue doing their original jobs.


The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. From 2013 to 2016, the station was partially renovated, with the station ceiling and northbound platform tilework replaced with replicas and flooring replaced. From January 5 to December 20, 2019, the station was closed so the elevator cars could be replaced, and elevator shafts, mechanical components, and the stairways could be upgraded. During this time, a free out-of-system transfer was provided to the A train at Inwoodâ207th Street, from both 207th Street and 215th Street.


The Eighth Avenue Line station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)'s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. Construction of the whole line cost $191.2 million (equivalent to $3,626.7 million in 2020). While the IRT BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line already provided service to Washington Heights, the new Eighth Avenue subway via St. Nicholas Avenue provided an alternative route.


The A express train has always served the IND station since its inception in 1932. Local service was initially provided by the AA train from 168th Street to Chambers Street/World Trade Center; at the time, local services were denoted by double letters and express services by single letters. The AA was discontinued in 1933 when the CC was created to run on the local tracks along the Eighth Avenue and Concourse lines. The original BB train started running with the opening of the Sixth Avenue Line on December 15, 1940, ran as a rush-hour only local service starting at 168th StreetâWashington Heights. The ""B"" designation was originally intended to designate express trains originating in Washington Heights and going to Midtown Manhattan on the Sixth Avenue Line. The AA was resurrected when the BB was created, running outside rush hours. The AA was renamed the K in 1985, while the BB was renamed the B. The K train was completely replaced by the C's midday service on December 11, 1988, with all local service at 168th Street being provided by the B. On March 1, 1998, the B and the C switched northern terminals, ending B service to this station and bringing C trains to this station at all times except late nights.


The IND station was planned to be renovated starting in 2016 as part of the 2010â2014 MTA Capital Program. An MTA study conducted in 2015 found that 48 percent of components in the state were out of date.


The IRT platforms are very deep, with the only public connection between the platforms and fare control being made via elevator. Close to street level is an upper mezzanine level with an unstaffed fare control area. Four elevators lead down to a lower mezzanine below the IRT platforms.:â6â  At the upper mezzanine, a closed passageway exists behind the elevator bank.


The IRT station is one of three stations in the New York City Subway system that can be accessed solely by elevators. The other two, also located on the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line, are 181st Street one stop to the north, as well as Clark Street on the 2 and â3 trains in Brooklyn. However, the IRT station is not ADA-accessible. As part of the 2017 Fast Forward plan to modernize the subway system, 50 more stations will become ADA-accessible during the MTA's 2020â2024 Capital Program, allowing all riders to have an accessible station within two stops in either direction.:â41â To meet this goal, one station in the Washington Heights/Inwood area will have to be made accessible on the IRT BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line. The 168th Street station was ultimately selected to be retrofitted as part of the plan.


A slightly sloped corridor within fare control leads between the IRT and IND mezzanines.:â6â A full length mezzanine extends above the IND platforms. Elevators from the mezzanine to the street, and to each IND platform, make that portion of the station ADA-accessible.


The full-time fare control area is at the center of the mezzanine, and has a turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase and one elevator going up to the southeast corner of West 168th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue. The part-time side at the north end of the mezzanine has HEET turnstiles and three staircases, two to the southwest corner of Broadway and 169th Street and one to the northwest corner. An exit-only turnstile in the middle of the mezzanine, near the corridor leading to the IRT platforms, leads to a staircase going up to north end of Mitchell Square Park on the south side of West 168th Street between Broadway and Saint Nicholas Avenue.


The passageway leading to the IRT elevators is just beyond the full-time fare control area. There are two exit stairs past this part-time fare control area, near the southwest corner of Broadway and 168th Street, which face north and south.:â6â


The southernmost portion of the mezzanine, which is outside fare control, is closed. It features one passage on the east side of the IND station with two exits to the southeastern corner of 167th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue and a passage on the west side of the IND station with two exits to Mitchel Square Park. The closed mezzanine area is now used for New York City Transit employees only. The western area was closed in the 1980s for safety reasons, while the eastern area was closed in 1992.

168th Street on the IRT BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line has two tracks and two side platforms,:â3â and is served by the 1 train at all times.  It is one of three in the Fort George Mine Tunnel, along with the 181st Street and 191st Street stations to the north; the tunnel allows the BroadwayâSeventh Avenue Line to travel under the high terrain of Washington Heights.:â165â


Near the north end of the station, there are four elevators adjacent to the southbound platform, which lead to the fare control level. These elevators are accessed via a concourse several steps above the southbound platform. The lower sections of the concourse walls are clad with white tile, topped by a band of green tile, while the tops of the walls and the ceilings are made of concrete. Two footbridges with staircases connect the platforms.:â6â A rear passageway at the lower mezzanine level allows passengers to board and alight on different sides of the elevator cabs.


The northern open bridge and northbound platform features a passageway east of the northbound side to an eastern elevator shaft.:â4â This shaft contained the two original elevators to and from the platforms.:â4â The eastern elevator tower was partially destroyed when the IND platforms were built; the space has since been repurposed as a ventilation chamber. There is a closed stairway on the extreme northern end of both platforms, which ascends to a relay and signal power room. This stairway is not visible to the public.:â5â


Much of the station is contained within a vault that measures 47 feet (14Â m) wide and 26 feet (7.9Â m) high.:â3â The lowest 6 feet (1.8Â m) of the vault walls are wainscoted with rust-colored brick. Atop the brick wainscoting are a belt course made of marble and a multicolored mosaic frieze measuring about 16 inches (410Â mm) thick. The tops of the walls contain tan brick. Tile name tablets are placed above the frieze at regular intervals, with white letters on a dark-green background surrounded by floral designs. These tablets contain the text ""168th Street"".:â5â The center of the vault ceiling has multicolored terracotta medallions at regular intervals; these formerly held lighting fixtures.


The station's platform extensions have ceilings that are 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7Â m) above the platform level. At the portals between the original vault and the much lower ceilings of the platform extensions, there is a wide arch over the tracks flanked by narrow arches over each platform. These transitions are clad with tan brick.  The arch over the tracks has a volute with a laurel wreath. Between the arches, the lower portions of the walls are clad in gray marble.:â4â The walls of the platform extensions have white ceramic tiles with mosaic friezes as well as plaques with the words ""168th Street"". The walls are divided every 15 feet (4.6Â m) by multicolored tile pilasters that are 16 inches (410Â mm) wide. There are two tile panels with the number ""168"" in each panel. Columns near the platform edge, clad with white tile, support the jack-arched concrete station roof.:â5â

168th Street is an express station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line that has four tracks and two island platforms. It is served by the A train at all times, and the C train at all times except late nights. Unlike other express stations in the subway system, the inner tracks serve C local trains while the outer tracks serve A express trains during the daytime. This is to make it easier for C trains to terminate here, and turn around to make the southbound trip to Brooklyn. South of this station, the outer tracks descend to a lower level below the inner tracks, creating a two-over-two track layout. North of the station, the inner tracks continue north underneath Broadway to the 174th Street Yard, while the outer tracks turn sharply under Fort Washington Avenue before continuing to Inwoodâ207th Street. During the night, A trains make local stops, using the northbound local and southbound express tracks at this station.


Both outer track walls have a maroon trim line with a black border and small ""168"" tile captions below them in white numbering on a black border. This station has a full length mezzanine above the platforms and tracks. Black I-beam columns run along the platform, alternating ones having the standard black name plate with white lettering.

He has been the subject of controversy over a number of acts of electronic civil disobedience on his own and with the Electronic Disturbance Theater, which he co-founded.


Dominguez, the founder of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, has organized ""virtual sit-ins"" that attempted to overload and crash websites, for which he and his co-founder developed a program called FloodNet that automatically requests the target page over and over. These events sometimes incorporated a search term, such that the search would return a phrase like ""Transparency not found"" in the University of California, San Diego website, or ""human rights not found"" at the website of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. On one occasion, the United States Department of Defense diverted a planned attack to a nonexistent website. One goal of the movement is solidarity with Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico.


Dominguez also helped develop a phone app called the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT), which would use GPS technology to help immigrants find water stations in the Southern California desert and which also includes a poetry feature. It also raises awareness about the number of people who die in the U.S.-Mexico border region and aims to rethink the ways in which ""immigrants are always presented as less-than-human and certainly not part of a community which is establishing and inventing new forms of life."" TBT was subject to considerable controversy initiated by three Republican California congressmen; ultimately the University of California stated that TBT did not misuse research funds, but would not comment on whether it had broken any laws.


In an interview, Dominguez reports that his work, along with that of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, ""has been to develop works that can create a performative matrix that activate and take a measure of the current conditions and intensities of power/s, communities and their anxieties or resistances.""


In 2015 the mother of one of his students claimed that her daughter was forced to perform nude for her final exam in the class. UCSD officials defended Dominguez saying that the course is not required for graduation and that removing clothing is not a requirement to pass.",0,28 December 2010, 30 May 2020,40,0,0

It is located in Akure, the capital city of Ondo State.


Other universities of technology established around the same time were the Federal University of Technology Owerri, the Federal University of Technology, Abeokuta (FUTAB), which later metamorphosed to the present University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), the Federal University of Technology Minna, the Federal University of Technology Yola, and the Federal University of Technology Bauchi (now Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University).


The university has nine Schools: 


The school runs pre-degree science programs, Short-Term courses and University Advanced Basic Science programs.

In 1980, one of the policy thrusts in education of the civilian government headed by Alhaji Aliyu Shehu Shagari was the creation of new universities of technology[citation needed]. The purpose, as announced by government, was in line with the national policy on education, with respect to technical and scientific training; namely, to develop, at every stage of the education system, a scientific and technological attitude in preparation for the nation's technological take-off. Thus, the states that had no federal universities â Bauchi, Benue, Gongola, Imo, Niger, Ogun and Ondo â became the immediate beneficiaries of this initiative. In the same year three such institutions were named for Bauchi, Benue and Imo. The other four were to commence in 1981.citation needed The Federal University of Technology, Akure thus came into being in 1981. By August, the government appointed the pioneer chancellor, HRH Alhaji Zulkarnaini Gambari Mohammed, Emir of lIorin. At that time, a 13-member Governing Council was announced, although the chairman of was not named until October. Late High Chief (Dr) Gabriel Akin-Deko was appointed the pioneer pro-chancellor and chairman of the Governing Council[citation needed].


On November 19, 1981, late Professor Theodore Idibiye Francis was appointed the vice-chancellor of the new university. Professor Francis had been a renowned professor of medicine at the University of Ibadan medical school (University College Hospital) and later moved to the newly established Institute of Health Sciences of the University of Port Harcourt as foundation provost. From Port Harcourt Francis moved to Akure on January 1, 1982 to begin the work of getting the university on a footing. One of the first things he did was to recruit senior staff with whom to begin the vistas of the foundation work. Thus, after some consultations, Francis appointed Mr. Ayorinde O. Ogunruku, the first senior staff member of the new university (other than his personal driver, Mr. Etim Udoh) as the first administrative officer, on January 12, 1982.


When the announcement to establish a university in Ondo was made, it was not immediately clear where it was going to be sited. When eventually Akure was chosen and the site housing the federal polytechnic was decided, it was clear that the new university might encounter some difficulties in getting started. The polytechnic had built and inhabited the site since 1977 when it had been forced by the federal government to move to Akure from its original location in Jos, Plateau State capital. Thus, when the announcement was made locating the university in Akure, the polytechnic authorities were understandably uneasy. When a letter dated 18 December 1981 conveyed the information to the rector that the new university would take over the polytechnic site and his institution was to move, albeit in phases, once again, to a new location in Ado-Ekiti, the undercurrents of agitation excited by the earlier announcement of the establishment of the university boiled over[citation needed].


It was not surprising that when vice-chancellor Francis arrived in Akure on 1 January 1982 he was given only a room in the establishment wing of the polytechnic as his office. From there, the work of the new university commenced. With the arrival of more staff members and increased activities and the reluctance of the polytechnic authorities to release any more space, negotiations on effecting a smooth transfer commenced in February between the two heads of the institutions. The expected difficulties attending these negotiations compelled the then Minister of Education to inaugurate a meeting of the joint Councils of the institutions on 27 April 1982. In the meantime, however, on account of increased activities and the need to get the many organs of the university system in place before students could resume, the vice-chancellor rented a three-storey building at No. 98, Oyemekun Road in Akure from where all administrative activities were to continue[citation needed].


The joint Councils negotiation meetings continued and, with the intervention of the Minister of Education, eventually, some six buildings meant for academic activities were released to the university by 25 August 1982. In addition, 13 duplex bungalows, 20 three-bedroom and 15 four-bedroom bungalows and one four-bedroom storey buildings were also released.


While negotiations continued with the polytechnic, the university had set some targets, which had to be met. Academic activities had been scheduled to begin in November 1982, yet much was lacking in terms of facilities. So the university rented three blocks of flats at Oba-lIe to provide residence for the student intake and started construction of a cafeteria, a storey building for staff offices, and laboratories and a block of lecture rooms for the School of Pure and Applied Sciences. The latter was later turned to the staff primary school. Modification work on structures released by the polytechnic commenced.


For the academic activities scheduled for November, vice-chancellor Francis constituted some ""Academic Planning Task Forces"" to prepare the academic briefs of the three foundation schools: Agriculture and Agricultural Technology, Earth and Mineral Sciences, and Pure and Applied Sciences. To continue the work and implementation of the briefs, the official organs of the University were being established. By July 1982, Council had appointed other principal officers and most of these them assumed duties in August.


With the initial core of academics and principal officers in place, Senate, the organ charged with responsibility for academic matters, was then constituted and the body held its inaugural meeting on 27 October 1982 at the Council/Senate Chamber of the University's Temporary Administrative Office at 98, Oyemekun Road. The day/date of the inaugural meeting has been the basis for the tradition of statutory Senate meetings on the last Wednesday of the month. That first Senate included Professor T. I. Francis (vice-chancellor & chairman), Professor D. A. Okorie (head, Department of Chemistry), Professor L. K. Opeke (ag. dean, School of Agriculture & Agricultural Technology) Mr. F. A. Akinyotu (university librarian), late Professor M. O. Olofinboba (dean, School of Pure & Applied Sciences) was absent, Dr. J. A. Osanyinbi (academic registrar) was the secretary. The inaugural meeting of Senate considered the state of readiness for admission of students for academic activities; the draft University Act; Senate Standing Orders, among other issues. Recruitment of academic and other staff was well on course and, by September, some had assumed duties.


On 22 November 1982, FUTA welcomed its first set of students (onto the campus still shared with the polytechnic). Arrangements had been made for their accommodation in a rented block of apartments at Oba-lie, a satellite town some 15 kilometers away. Classroom and laboratory blocks had been prepared; the academic staff that had reported were already sharing a ""staff room"" of the newly completed wing of the staff primary school. Reconstruction and finishing work were getting other facilities in place for full activities on the campus. Full academic activities commenced on 29 November 1982, after a week of orientation for the students. On 22 January 1983, the university held its first matriculation for 149 students.


At its second meeting on 24 November 1983, Senate elected the first set of four persons to represent it on the university's Governing Council: Professors M. O. Olofinboba, L. K. Opeke, D. A. Okorie and Mr. F. A. Akinyotu[citation needed]. This first set was given a one-year term beginning 10 January 1983. By its eighth meeting on 26 October 1983, Senate received the first set of the university's congregation representatives on that body. The two were Engr. (Dr) S. O. Falaki and Dr. (Mrs.) A. P. O. Dede.


The university's School of Computing (abbreviated as SOC) was founded in 2018, it was created to cater to the needs of departments that were more related to computer science than general science. It is located in the Obanla campus of FUTA.
  This school has five subsidiary departments:

The archaeological site of Ansanto Valley (Valle d'Ansanto), better known as ""Mefite"", is a sulphurous lake valley, few kilometres from the towns of Villamaina and Torella dei Lombardi. It was named after the ancient Italic goddess Mefitis, venerated by the people of Hirpini, and counts some ruins of a sanctuary of the 7th century BC. The little lake is formed by a pool of water, about 2 metres (7Â ft) deep, that boils as a result of the gas emissions of the subsoil, consisting primarily of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid. Because of this poisonous emissions, the surrounding area is free of animals and vegetation.

Dole United States Courthouse in Kansas City, Kansas, the Frank Carlson Federal Building in Topeka, and the United States Courthouse in Wichita. The District of Kansas was created in 1861, replacing the territorial court that preceded it, and President Abraham Lincoln appointed Archibald Williams as the Court's first judge. 


Appeals from the District of Kansas are made to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).


As of FebruaryÂ 28, 2021[update] the Acting United States Attorney is Duston Slinkard. On March 12, 2015, Ron Miller, most recently police chief of Topeka, Kansas, was confirmed as U.S. Marshal.


The Clerk of Court is Timothy M. O'Brien, who is located in Kansas City.


As of DecemberÂ 2, 2020[update]:


Chief judges have administrative responsibilities with respect to their district court. Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the district court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.


When the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.",4,20 August 2004, 30 March 2021,210,0,0

Written by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, the book is an unauthorized reimagining of characters and situations from Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up by J. M. Barrie, and tells the story of an orphan named Peter.  It was illustrated by artist Greg Call. It is a sequel and fourth installment to Barry and Pearson's ""Starcatchers"" series, best-sellers released in 2004â2007, which was originally said at the time to be a trilogy. This book was released on October 13, 2009.  The next book, called The Bridge to Neverland, was published in 2011.


The story is set in 1902, 23 years after the events of Peter and the Secret of Rundoon. Molly Aster, now Molly Darling, is married to George Darling and a mother of three: Wendy, John, and Michael. Her mother Louise has been deceased for a while and her father Leonard is very ill. One evening, she is visited by one of the original Lost Boys: James, who now works for Scotland Yard. He informs Molly about his suspicions with Baron von Schatten, an advisor to Prince Albert Edward. James thinks von Schatten is being controlled by Lord Ombra, but Molly brushes it off as foolishness, saying that Ombra was destroyed at Rundoon. Along with this, the Starcatchers started disbanding since the incident. James tells her he will come back the next night, giving her some time to think the whole thing over, as he has nowhere else to turn.


Meanwhile, on Mollusk Island, four men known as McPherson, O'Neal, Kelly and DeWulf wash up on shore in a boat. They claim to have been lost at sea for a few weeks, but Chief Fighting Prawn becomes suspicious when he says that they look like they were out at sea for a few days. He and Peter keep a close eye on the four men, especially O'Neal.


Back in London, Molly has waited three days, and James has still not returned. She starts to fear that he might be in real danger. Anxious to find out what is going on, Molly goes to the Scotland Yard, only to be told by his employer, Blake, that he is on vacation. Puzzled, Molly returns home and is almost grabbed by a bobby on the Underground. George is not too pleased when she tells him her story. He fears that he could lose his job due to a minor incident like this. Molly decides to talk to Wendy about the Starcatchers, knowing that her daughter is the only one who could understand. So, after Molly tells her daughter that she is actually in the Starcatchers, Molly sets off to her father's house, hoping to find some answers. But she, too, mysteriously disappears.


Meanwhile, a hideous man-like monster named The Skeleton, one of the ""Others"" that can cause pain with but a mere touch, looks for the missing tip of the sword Curtana - a.k.a. the Sword of Mercy. He finds it in a church window, disguised as a bishop's miter.


To keep his children safe, George sends them to stay in Cambridgeshire with Neville Plonk-Fenster, an inventor and their uncle. At Uncle Neville's place, Wendy is able to get an ornithopter, one of her uncle's inventions and uses it to find Peter. Before this, she visits her grandfather, Leonard Aster, who tells her to seek out Peter. Before he loses consciousness, he tells her to ""confess"". Wendy is confused, though, as she has no clue as to what he meant.


In Molly's prison, she notices that men pass her prison every day. She believes they have been digging because of their dirty appearance.


Wendy finally finds Peter on Mollusk Island with the help of some porpoises leading her through the ocean one at a time in the right direction. She convinces him to come back to England with her to stop the ""Others.""


In order to return Wendy to England, Fighting Prawn devises a plan to help Captain Hook resurrect the sunken flying ship from the previous novel (which no longer flies) so Hook can use it to return to piracy and deliver Wendy to England. After the ship is pulled from the sea Fighting Prawn threatens Hook that if he does not bring Wendy to England, he will hunt him down, bring him back to the Island, and feed him to the Islands giant crocodile named Mister Grin. At Fighting Prawns' request, Hook agrees to bring the four shipwrecked men with him in order to get them off the island. Unknown to Hook, Peter stows away on the ship by hiding in its rolled up sails so he can also arrive in London to help Wendy. Since he thinks Peter is dead, Hook does not suspect him to be on his ship.


When Hook tries to attack a steam ship, Peter, Wendy, and Tinker Bell fly to the steam ship when it collides with the Jolly Rodger (the name Hook gives to the recently resurrected ship) at the same time the four shipwrecked sailors escape their cell and leave in a lifeboat unseen by the pirates. From here, they paddle back to Mollusk Island to complete their mission to grab the large cache of starstuff from the island. Peter and Wendy are taken back to London once they are discovered as stowaways aboard the steam ship.


Arriving at the Island, McPherson, O'Neal, Kelly, and DeWulf make a smoke signal with vegetation and a lava pit in order to signal their own ship, the Nimbus, to come to the Island. 


Upon arriving in London, Wendy, Peter and Tinker Bell escape the police with the help of some rats (whom Tinker bell can speak to), and from there travel to Lord Asters' house where, after avoiding bobbies watching the house, meet up with John, Michael, Neville, Mrs. Bumbrake, and Lord Aster.


After defeating Lord Ombra and the ""Others"", Molly returns home with Wendy, where they are reunited with George, John, and Michael. The story ends with Wendy telling her brothers about Peter Pan and hearing a strange noise from the window as Wendy starts her story.


Peter: Peter is a boy who is stuck between the ages of 12 and 14 forever. He lives on Mollusk Island, where another of the main characters:Wendy, finds him and begs for his help. He is reluctant to come but something inside him wills Peter to do so. He is at one point touched by the Skeleton and has the severe pain it is able to cause inflicted on him. After this encounter, he attempts to avoid the Skeleton for the rest of the journey. He has feelings for Molly and is troubled when he learns that she married George.


Tinker Bell Tinker Bell is a fairy or ""birdwoman"". Who dislikes most females capable of  ""getting between her and Peter, especially Molly"". She can be jealous and is very, very protective of Peter.


The Skeleton The Skeleton is some sort of Man Monster that can inflict severe pain with just a touch of his claw like hand. He is working with the ""Others"". He kills Lord Aster. He is killed on the flying train at the end of the novel.  He is on a mission to acquire the tip of Curtana aka ""The Sword of Mercy"".


Baron von Schatten Baron von Schatten is an evil baron who is possessed with Lord Ombra. He also works with the ""Others"". He is electrocuted and killed. Ombra survives and comes out of him. He is severely weakened on the flying train near the end of the novel.


Wendy Darling Wendy is a girl at age 11 and is the daughter of Molly Aster and George Darling. After her mother disappears, she finds Peter and together they go to defeat the ""Others"". She loves her mother and does not approve when Molly tries to sacrifice herself in order to stop the ""Others"". Wendy also has come to enjoy telling her brother about Peter Pan by the end of the story.


James Smith James is one of the former Lost Boys and has now grown up. He works for Scotland Yard. He is the first to realize that Lord Ombra has returned and is captured by the ""Others"", along with Molly.  He is a friend of Peters. He is cut on the head by von Schatten near the end of the book but he survives.


Molly Aster Molly Aster is wife of George Daring and the mother of Wendy, John, and Michael. She is captured by the ""Others"" after she tries to search for James. Due to her past romantic feelings for Peter, she is glad to see him when he comes to help. She plans to sacrifice herself to stop the ""Others"".


John and Michael John and Michael are the younger brothers of Wendy. John is 7 and Michael is 4. John consistently calls Michael a ""ninny"". They squabble a lot.


George Darling George is Molly's husband and the father of Wendy, John, and Michael. He is captured along with Molly and James by the ""Others"". He somewhat dislikes Peter, due to the romantic feelings that Peter and Molly have for each other.


Neville Plonk-Fenster Neville is the uncle of Wendy, John, and Michael. He is an inventor and, despite having limited success at his inventions, is still an intelligent man when it comes to science. He often gets caught up in his inventions and becomes oblivious to the rest of the world, but doesn't hesitate to help defeat the ""Others"" with his friends. His scientific knowledge proves valuable throughout the novel.


Simon Revile Revile is one of the Baron's workers. He is afraid of the Baron. He wants to save his own skin more than anything. He is afraid of the Skeleton as well.


Scarlett Johns Johns is one of the Skeleton's acquaintances. She is afraid of both the Baron and the Skeleton. She wants to save her own skins more than anything like Revile.


Fighting Prawn Fighting Prawn is the chief of the Mollusk tribe on Mollusk Island. He is a good friend and somewhat of a mentor to Peter. While Peter is in London, Fighting Prawn deals with Captain Narezza and his men when they attempt to steal the Islands starstuff.


Mr Magill Mr Magill is a Starcatcher who provides a shelter for Wendy, Peter, Neville, John, Michael, and Molly's previous tutor, Mrs Bumbrake. He owns a bear and several tame wolves. He also comes into Peter and the Shadow Thieves and is mentioned in Bridge to Neverland.

64218670,Irydion,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irydion,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irydion&action=info,"Irydion is a drama written by Polish poet Zygmunt KrasiÅski. He begun work on it in 1832 and published it in 1836. It debuted on stage in 1913 at Teatr Polski in Warsaw.


It remains one of KrasiÅski's best known works.


The action of the drama takes place in Ancient Rome around 222 CE. during the reign of Elagabalus. The basic motive of the play is the rebellion of Greek Irydion, son of Amfiloch, against the Romans - a transparent allusion to the tragedy of the Polish November Uprising. The story is focused on the dilemma that revolves around a contradiction between the legitimate and noble aim of overthrowing despotism and the more prosaic motivation of Irydion's actions (revenge) and the despicable means (deception, ruthlessness) he uses in order to advance his goal. The hero's tragedy results from taking premature actions, as well as the destructive influence of ancient fate.


In Irydion, KrasiÅski again takes up the theme of societal decay. He condemns the excesses of revolutionary movements, arguing that motives such as retribution have no place within the Christian ethic; many contemporaries, however, saw the play as an endorsement of militant struggle for Poland's independence, whereas KrasiÅski's intent was to advocate for organic work as a means to society's advancement. KrasiÅski began writing Irydion before his more enduring work, the drama The Undivine Comedy, but published it after the latter. CzesÅaw MiÅosz comments that, while Irydion is a work of considerable talent, especially in its insightful analysis of the decadence of Rome, it is not on a par with The Undivine Comedy.",1,9 June 2020, 31 August 2021,18,1,1

56798962,Thomas William Marshall (painter),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_William_Marshall_(painter),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_William_Marshall_(painter)&action=info,"Thomas William Marshall was an English post-impressionist painter and water colorist, born on (1875-10-28)October 28, 1875 at Donisthorpe in England. He passed away on (1914-09-14)September 14, 1914 in Paris.


He painted landscapes, portraits, nudes and produced watercolours, in Paris, in Ãle-de-France, in Normandy, on the French Riviera and in Corsica. Between 1904 and 1914, He exhibited his work in Paris at the Salon d'Automne, as well as the Salon des IndÃ©pendants and also at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts. These art salons were at the peak of their glory, in this era, with well known painters such as Marquet, Modigliani, Sickert, Kandinsky, participating in them.


Thomas William Marshall was born in 1875 in Donisthorpe, Derbyshire in England. He was the son of Robert Aldred Marshall (1852-1884) a wealthy mining engineer from Nottinghamshire who died in the Bullhouse Bridge rail accident, and Dorothy Ann Tarr (1852â1879). He is a first cousin of the rugby player Frank Tarr. Thomas William studied in both Oxford and in Cambridge.


Wishing to become a painter despite his fragile health, he left England to live in Paris in 1897 and enrolled in the AcadÃ©mie Julian. There he met the Canadian painter Albert Henry Robinson, who would become his student and friend. In Paris he was reunited with his English friends, also painters, such as Ernest Yarrow Jones (1872â1951). As of 1900, he began to participate successfully in some Parisian exhibitions. His studio was located at 3 rue Campagne-PremiÃ¨re, he then moved to 51 rue de SÃ¨vres, and then relocated to 49 boulevard du Montparnasse.


In 1904, he participated for the first time in the Salon d'Automne where he would show an average of five to six paintings or watercolours per salon, every year until 1913. He was named as a member of the Salon in 1908. During this time, he showed works at the Salon des IndÃ©pendants in 1906 and then from 1908 to 1914. He also showed his works at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1911 and at the London Salon (of the Allied Artists Association) in London from 1908 to 1914. Thomas William Marshall was one of the founding members of the London Salon with Walter Sickert.


Thomas William Marshall was a member of the Golf Club of Paris (SociÃ©tÃ© de golf de Paris) and played at the golf de La BoulieÂ [fr] when he started. Therefore, he produced many drawings and caricatures inspired by this sport.


Due to his fragile health, he left for the CÃ´te d'Azur and settled in Corse in 1908, where he produced a large part of his body of work (oil on canvas or on cardboard, watercolours and caricatures). He transferred works he had created in Corsica onto canvas:landscapes and scenes inspired by daily life on the island back to Paris for exhibition. These works gained him much praise from the art critics of that era.


In 1910, Thomas William Marshall married Marie-Louise DÃ©sagullier who had been his companion and model for many years. He died prematurely from tuberculosis on (1914-09-14)September 14, 1914 in Paris, at the age of 38, at the height of his talent. He was cremated at cimetiÃ¨re du PÃ¨re-Lachaise and his ashes are resting at the columbarium (87th division, niche nÂ° 2137).


Wealthier than many of the contemporary artists of his time, he did not really need to sell much of his art to live; as a result, he remained relatively unknown until his rediscovery by art critic Yann Le PichonÂ [fr] in 1984. One of Thomas William Marshall's paintings, a landscape of Corsica painted in 1910, was selected by a specialized jury and art lovers, displayed at the Espace Pierre Cardin at the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es and was reproduced in colour in an edition of the magazine Paris-Match in December 1984.


Many exhibitions to honour his work followed: at the Salon des IndÃ©pendants in Paris in 1986, at the Salon d'Automne in 1987 where an entire room was dedicated in tribute to him, and two personal exhibitions in Bastia in 1988 and in Villefranche-sur-mer in 1993. The Beauvais museum acquired a painting in 1987. Bastia and Villefranche-sur-Mer museums each have conserved one or more of his works in their public collections.


Recognized by Jacques Foucart, general curator at the Paintings Department of the MusÃ©e du Louvre, the pictorial work of the English painter Thomas William Marshall, is both inspired by the last sparkling embers of the 19th century and by the end of Impressionism. Composed of numerous oil paintings and watercolours, of rare quality, his work can be added to the post-impressionist and symboliste movements. Also certain pieces could be considered neo-Japonard or nabis. Regardless of how one classifies it, his work remains deeply original.

He was the national champion in 1969 and 1975, and represented Australia at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and the 1967 Summer Universiade.


Vlahov was born in Perth, with both his parents being Croatian immigrants. He attended Perth Junior Technical School and Kent Street Senior High School, and then went on to the University of Western Australia, where he received an initial Bachelor of Economics (B.Ec.) degree and then completed a Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree.


Vlahov was the Western Australian state champion in the discus 20 times, and runner-up on another four occasions. He also won the state shot put title three times, the decathlon twice, and the hammer throw once. Between 1960 and 1975, Vlahov medalled for Western Australia in thirteen editions of the Australian Open Track and Field Championships. He won two gold medals (in 1969 and 1975), nine silver medals, and three bronze medals. With the exception of a bronze medal for the shot put in 1969, all of his medals were for the discus.


At the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, hosted in Perth, Vlahov was one of four Australians selected to compete in the men's discus event. He placed sixth overall with a throw of 158Â feet 5Â inches (48.29Â m), and was the second-best Australian behind gold medallist Warwick Selvey. Vlahov also represented Australia at the 1967 Summer Universiade in Tokyo, and served as the flag-bearer. He threw 52.52 metres (172Â ft 4Â in) to place fourth overall, landing 0.64 metres (2Â ft 1Â in) behind bronze medallist Neal Steinhauer of the United States.


Vlahov completed a doctorate in education at Murdoch University, and eventually became a professor at Edith Cowan University. He also conducted work at the University of Oregon in the United States. A member of the Lutheran Church of Australia, Vlahov was chairman of the group behind the establishment of the Living Waters Lutheran College, Western Australia's only Lutheran school at the time of its opening.


Vlahov died of cancer in 1997, aged 56. He was married to Eva Kampe, who also represented Australia in athletics at the 1962 Perth Games.

The song tells the story of Nelson being booed at a concert at Madison Square Garden. It was Nelson's last Top 40 hit, reaching 6 on the U.S. Billboard charts


On October 15, 1971, Richard Nader's Rock 'n Roll Revival concert was given at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The playbill included many greats of the early rock era, including Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Bobby Rydell.


Nelson came on stage dressed in the then-current fashion, wearing bell-bottoms and a purple velvet shirt, with his hair hanging down to his shoulders. He started playing his older songs like ""Hello Mary Lou"", but then he played the Rolling Stones' ""Country Honk"" (a country version of their hit song ""Honky Tonk Women"") and the crowd began to boo. While some reports say that the booing was caused by police action in the back of the audience, Nelson thought it was directed at him. Nevertheless, he sang another song but then left the building and did not appear onstage for the finale.


""Garden Party"" tells of various people who were present, frequently in an oblique manner (""Yoko brought her Walrus"", referring to Yoko Ono and John Lennon), with a chorus:


But it's all right now, I've learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you've got to please yourself


One more reference in the lyrics pertains to a particularly mysterious and legendary audience member: ""Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes, wearing his disguise"". The Mr. Hughes in question was ex-Beatle George Harrison, who was a next-door neighbor and good friend of Nelson. Harrison used ""Hughes"" as his traveling alias, and ""hid in Dylan's shoes"" most likely refers to an album of Bob Dylan covers that Harrison was planning but never recorded.[citation needed] ""Wearing his disguise"" also suggests that Harrison traveled incognito.[citation needed]


""Garden Party"" reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the fall of 1972; it was Nelson's last top 40 hit on the US pop charts. The song also topped the Billboard Easy Listening chart for two weeks and reached number 44 on Billboard's Country Singles chart. The song likewise reached number six in both Australia and South Africa and number one in Canada.





Ricky Nelson re-recorded ""Garden Party"" with The Jordanaires and studio musicians for his 1985 album All My Best.


Country singer Johnny Lee recorded a cover version of the song in the late 1970s, entitled ""Country Party"", with slightly altered lyrics. Dwight Yoakam has also performed it live in concert. In 2000 Tarsha Vega sampled ""Garden Party"" in her song ""Be Ya Self"" for the soundtrack for The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.


The UK band, Smokie, recorded a cover of the song.


In 2009, John Fogerty recorded the song with the Eagles' Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit, for his The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again album.


In 2012, Adam Young of Owl City covered the song and released it to his SoundCloud and personal blog followers. The song was pulled off of SoundCloud in late 2015, but can still be found on YouTube.


On December 31, 2012, Phish opened their New Year's Eve concert with the song at Madison Square Garden. Phish bassist and singer Mike Gordon, who sang lead on the tune, wore a shirt very reminiscent of the one George Harrison wore on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.


Gary Pig Gold recorded his own personal take on the song, which reflected an encounter with Rick himself and appeared, in 2013, on Pop Garden Radio's Legacy: A Tribute to Rick Nelson Volume 1 CD.

The municipalities of Medeglia, Bironico, Camignolo, Rivera and Sigirino merged on 21 November 2010 into the new municipality of Monteceneri.


Bironico is first mentioned in 1296 as Bironico.  By 1000, Bironico was probably the secular and religious center of Carvina, which included the middle and upper Vedeggio valley.  For example, former parish included the villages of Camignolo, Ison, Medeglia, Mezzovico-Vira, Rivera, Robasacco and Sigirino.  In the Early Middle Ages it was under the authority of the bishop of Como, followed by the city of Como.  At the end of the 13th Century, the Rusca, a noble family from Como, lived in the community.  They lived in the castle between 1328-1416.  Starting in the 16th Century, an inn at the bridge over the Leguana served as a meeting place of the Swiss Confederation's ministers.


The parish church is from 1267 and is dedicated to St. Martin.


In the past, the local economy relied on traditional alpine agriculture and emigration.  Trade and industry have recently increased, but the current economic structure is dominated by commuters to the lower Vedeggio valley, Lugano and Bellinzona.

24690443,Arne Berge,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Berge,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arne_Berge&action=info,"Arne Berge (29 June 1908 â 13 August 1988) was a Norwegian priest. He was seamen's priest in Hamburg during World War II, when he also worked among Scandinavian prisoners in Germany, and helped planning and carrying out the operation of the White Buses (De Hvide Busser).


Berge was born in Stavanger as the son of stereotyper Alfred Berge (1878-1962) and his wife Albertine Johanne  HusebÃ¸ (1879-1956). He finished his examen artium at the University of Oslo in 1928, and graduated as cand.theol. in 1934. He was assistant priest in Modum from 1935 to 1936. From 1937 to 1940 he was a priest in Oslo.


Berge was  priest at the Seamen's Church (SjÃ¸mannskirken) in Hamburg during the Second World War. Berge took over the position previously held by Finn Moestue Husebye, when Huseby had to leave Hamburg because of a conflict with Nazi-friendly Norwegian settlers in Germany.


Together with his assistant priest Conrad Vogt-Svendsen he also worked among Scandinavian prisoners in Nazi Germany, making thousands of visits on behalf of the prisoners' families. They distributed large quantities of clothes and food to prisoners all over Germany. Berge and Vogt-Svendsen compiled extensive lists of prisons and prisoners, which were sent to Stockholm and later used as a basis for the White Buses operation in Spring 1945. They also passed on information on planned mass liquidation of concentration camp prisoners towards the end of the war. The Seamen's Church in Hamburg remained intact until Easter 1945, when it was destroyed in a bomb attack on Good Friday, an attack which killed the church's caretaker Oskar M. Olsen.


After  the liberation of Norway, he was a priest at Ilebu prison from 1946, and priest in Horten from 1950. Berge was decorated Knight, First class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1945, for his work for prisoners in Germany. He was also awarded the Danish King Christian X's Liberty Medal.",0,14 October 2009, 4 July 2021,35,0,0
38980995,Competition and Markets Authority,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Competition_and_Markets_Authority&action=info,"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is the competition regulator in United Kingdom. It is a non-ministerial government department in the United Kingdom, responsible for strengthening business competition and preventing and reducing anti-competitive activities. The CMA launched in shadow form on 1 October 2013 and began operating fully on 1 April 2014, when it assumed many of the functions of the previously existing Competition Commission and Office of Fair Trading, which were abolished. Currently, they have around 600 employees.


On 15 March 2012 the UK Government's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) announced proposals for strengthening competition in the UK by merging the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission to create a new single Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The formation of the CMA was enacted in Part 3 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, which received royal assent on 25 April 2013.


In July 2012, Lord Currie was appointed chairman designate of the CMA and in January 2013 Alex Chisholm was appointed Chief Executive designate. The term 'designate' was dropped when the CMA was launched on 1 October 2013.


On 15 July 2013 BIS announced the first stage of an open public consultation period and published a summary, setting out the background to the consultation and inviting views on the draft guidance for the CMA. The first stage of the consultation ended on 6 September 2013. On 17 September, BIS announced the second stage of the consultation, which closed on 7 November 2013.


During 2013 and 2014, the CMA announced several waves of appointments at director level, reporting to members of the senior executive team.


On 28 March 2014 the CMA published the Rules of Procedure for CMA merger, market and special reference groups
following a consultation which ran from 21 February to 18 March.


On 26 July 2017, Andrea Coscelli was appointed chief executive officer of the Competition and Markets Authority.


On 20 June 2018, Andrew Tyrie took up his role as the new Chair of the CMA, taking over from Lord Currie.


On 12 August 2019, The CMA's London office moved to The Cabot, 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf.


In situations where competition could be unfair or consumer choice may be affected, the CMA is responsible for:


The CMA currently lists 5 strategic goals:


In December 2019, the Commission released a report recommending the curtailment of the duopoly of Google and Facebook. The general election meant that the report was not presented to the Government in December; in particular, this prevented the carrying of ideas, such as the sharing of 90% of online data provided to the company with other companies, to fruition.


The UK Competition Commission ruled several times against MyFerryLink, an English passenger and ferry freight company, preventing its operations from Dover despite the French competition authority authorising cross-channel activity. The French government blamed the decision to ban one out of three ferry operators on fair-trade concerns. The appeals court overturned these rulings, as MyFerryLink was not a merger of the bankrupt SeaFrance and Eurotunnel, the latter of which remains responsible for the management of the Channel Tunnel. MyFerryLink called attention to a potential conflict of interest, pointing out that the former accountant of DFDS, the competitor and plaintiff of the case, was now a member of the UK Competition Commission. Following these delays, Eurotunnel, owner of the boats rented to MyFerryLink, sold two new boats to the aforementioned competitor. Due to this, the port of Calais was blocked by workers, boats were occupied and the Channel Tunnel attacked, resulting in cross-channel disruption and traffic jams in the UK and France.


The UK Competition Commission ruled against the merger between Illumina and Pacific Biosciences in 2019. Some experts in the field of DNA sequencing considered that this would be bad news for Pacific Biosciences, although others considered the CMA's decision to be within their remit. The US Federal Trade Commission argued along the same lines as the CMA's decision later in 2019.


During an inquiry into the private healthcare market, the authority made the Private Healthcare Market Investigation Order in 2014.  This requires healthcare providers, including NHS trusts, to submit information to the Private Healthcare Information Network. This will include information about infection rates, rates of adverse incidents and the relative health improvement brought about by treatments. This will be broken down by consultants in 2018 and, in 2019, will extend to charges.",1,1 April 2013, 18 August 2021,200,0,0

6153416,Inductive sensor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_sensor,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inductive_sensor&action=info,"An inductive sensor is a device that uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to detect or measure objects. An inductor develops a magnetic field when a current flows through it; alternatively, a current will flow through a circuit containing an inductor when the magnetic field through it changes. This effect can be used to detect metallic objects that interact with a magnetic field. Non-metallic substances such as liquids or some kinds of dirt do not interact with the magnetic field, so an inductive sensor can operate in wet or dirty conditions.  


The inductive sensor is based on Faraday's law of induction. The temporal variations of the Magnetic Flux 



Î¦


{\displaystyle \Phi }

 through a N turns circuit will induce a voltage 



e


{\displaystyle e}

 which follows: 


which can be expressed in a simpler way:


by assuming that the induced magnetic field B is homogeneous over a section S (the Magnetic flux will be expressed 



Î¦
=
B
Ã
S


{\displaystyle \Phi =B\times S}

).


One form of inductive sensor drives a coil with an oscillator.  A metallic object approaching the coil will alter the inductance of the coil, producing a change in frequency or a change in the current in the coil. These changes can be detected, amplified, compared to a threshold and use to switch an external circuit. The coil may have a ferromagnetic core to make the magnetic field more intense and to increase the sensitivity of the device.  A coil with no ferromagnetic core (""air core"") can also be used, especially if the oscillator coil must cover a large area.  


Another form of inductive sensor uses one coil to produce a changing magnetic field, and a second coil (or other device) to sense the changes in the magnetic field produced by an object, for example, due to eddy currents induced in a metal object. 


Inductive sensors constitute the main element to build a search coil magnetometer, also known as a search coil. These are used in many fields of research: magnetotellurics, electromagnetic waves measurement, space magnetometers to investigate electromagnetic waves in space plasma as well as natural electromagnetic waves observations on Earth.


An inductive proximity sensor  is a non-contact electronic proximity sensor. It is used for positioning and detection of metal objects. The sensing range of an inductive switch is dependent on the type of metal being detected. Ferrous metals, such as iron and steel, allow for a longer sensing range, while nonferrous metals, such as aluminum and copper, may reduce the sensing range by up to 60 percent.


Since the output of an inductive sensor has two possible states, an inductive sensor is sometimes referred to as an inductive proximity switch.


The sensor consists of an induction loop or detector coil.  Most often this is physically a number of turns of insulated magnet wire wound around a high magnetic permeability core, such as a ferrite ceramic rod or coil form, and the winding may or may not have a feedback tap some number of turns from one end of the total winding.  It is connected to a capacitance to form a tuned frequency oscillator tank circuit.  In conjunction with a voltage or current gain device like a transistor or operational amplifier, this forms a tuned frequency oscillator.  When power is applied, the resulting oscillation is a high frequency alternating electric current in the coil that has a constantly changing magnetic field able to induces eddy currents in proximal (target) conductors.  The closer the target is and the greater its conductivity (metals are good conductors, for example), the greater the induced eddy currents are and the more effect their resulting opposing magnetic fields have on the magnitude and frequency of the oscillation.  Its magnitude is reduced as the load is increased in a non-magnetic conductor like aluminum because the induced field in the target opposes the source induction field, lowering net inductive impedance and therefore simultaneously tuning the oscillation frequency higher.  But that magnitude is less affected if the target is a highly magnetically permeable material, like iron, as that high permeability increases the coil inductance, lowering the frequency of oscillation.  


A change in oscillation magnitude may be detected with a simple amplitude modulation detector like a diode that passes the peak voltage value to a small filter to produce a reflective DC voltage value, while a frequency change may be detected by one of several kinds frequency discriminator circuits, like a phase lock loop detector, to see in what direction and how much the frequency shifts.  Either the magnitude change or the amount of frequency change can serve to defined a proximity distance at which the sensors go from on to off, or vice versa.


Common applications of inductive sensors include metal detectors, traffic lights, car washes, and a host of automated industrial processes. Because the sensor does not require physical contact it is particularly useful for applications where access presents challenges or where dirt is prevalent.


To control traffic signals at an intersection of roads, an induction loop can be buried in the pavement. A circuit connected to the loop can detect the change in its inductance when a vehicle passes over or stops on the loop.  This can be used to detect vehicles and adjust the timing of traffic signals or provide a turning signal at a busy intersection. 


Inductive sensors, also referred (in this area) as ""NMR coils"" or ""radiofrequency coils"", are used to detect the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field associated to the nuclear spin precession in Nuclear magnetic resonance.

They were related to the previous rulers of Alemannia, to the Bavarian Agilolfings and to the Geroldings. Their original power base was around the upper Neckar and Danube rivers. They came to possess lands in not only Alemannia, but also in Bavaria, Franconia and Italy.


The Ahalolfings are divided into two groups, the older and the younger. It is not certain how the two groups are related. The older group descends from a Berthold who was the joint founder, with Hnabi, of Reichenau Abbey in 724. His most famous descendant was Cadolah, Duke of Friuli, who defended the Pannonian plains into Italy from the Avars. 


Halaholf founded Marchtal Abbey as a proprietary monastery in the mid-8th century. His descendants gave it to the Abbey of Saint Gall in 776. In modern scholarship, the family is named after Halaholf, although in later generations the family's leading name was Berthold.


The younger branch of the family itself comprises two branches. Empress Richardis descends from Erchanger. Her sister married Berthold I and was the mother of the other branch of the family, which included the famous Erchanger, Duke of Swabia, and his brother Berthold II. The Ahalolfings died out when Berthold III died in 973, though the ZÃ¤hringen may be descended from them.",5,24 May 2007, 7 September 2021,37,3,2

63914858,List of islands of County Mayo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_County_Mayo,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_islands_of_County_Mayo&action=info,"This articles lists the islands of County Mayo, the mainland of which is part of the island of Ireland. Included in this list are named offshore and freshwater islands as recorded by Ordnance Survey Ireland or the Placenames Database of Ireland. Additionally, areas of ecological significance related to both offshore and freshwater islands, designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, are also listed.


Although County Mayo has hundreds of offshore and freshwater islands, only a handful of islands and island groups are large enough to be distinguishable on a typical map of the county, namely Achill Island, Clare Island and Inishturk, along with the island clusters of Duvillaun, Inishkea, Clew Bay and the major loughs. There are over 100 islands which are greater than 10 acres (4.0Â ha) in area. The largest island is Achill, which extends to 148Â km2 (37,000 acres), making it Ireland's largest offshore island.


Due to its abundance of bays, inlets and offshore islands, Mayo is reputed to have the longest coastline of any county in Ireland, at 1,168Â km (726Â mi) or approximately 21% of the total coastline of the State. The geology and geomorphology of the county and its islands is among the most varied and complex in Ireland.  Islands such as those at Clew Bay are low-lying, formed when rising sea levels drowned a vast field of drumlins, while others like Clare Island and Achill are characterised by mountains and towering sea-cliffs, of which Croaghaun are the third-highest in Europe, at 688Â m (2,257Â ft)


The bedrock geology of the islands is broadly divided into two groups. Those north of Clew Bay such as Achill and the islands off the Mullet Peninsula are generally of ancient Dalradian age, similar to Donegal and the Grampian Highlands. Inishglora contains some of the oldest rocks in Ireland, at 1.75 billion years old. Further south, the islands are much more diverse. Clare island alone is composed of Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Carboniferous terranes sutured together. Geologically, the Clew Bay islands themselves are the youngest in the county, formed during the Lower Carboniferous about 350 million years ago.


The county's offshore islands - and islands off the west coast of Ireland generally - developed their own distinct culture and traditions stretching back centuries. Records from the 1841 Census show that 47 of County Mayo's offshore islands were inhabited, with a combined population of approximately 10,000.[n 1]These islands were decimated by the Great Famine, resulting in either widespread or total depopulation. Towards the end of the 19th century the population of the larger islands began to recover somewhat, only to be set back by emigration following independence. The Irish government initially encouraged the evacuation of the islands due to the cost of providing services to them, further hastening the decline.


Today, the islands are recognised by the State as an integral part of Ireland's national heritage, preserving the remnants of a unique aspect of Irish culture. The remaining inhabited islands receive support and funding through the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. As of the 2016 Census, there are 2,700 people living on 14 of the county's offshore islands (of which 2,440 live on Achill), accounting for 1.87% of the county's population.


The 2016 census records 14 offshore islands as having a usually resident population. Achill has been connected to the mainland via bridge since 1887, making Clare Island the county's most populous unconnected island, with 159 inhabitants as of 2016. This makes Clare Island the fifth-most populous unconnected island in Ireland, after the three Aran Islands off Galway and Arranmore off Donegal.


Mayo County Council is responsible for the governance of the islands, and islanders are entitled to certain benefits and exemptions, such as lower motor tax rates. The islands also receive funding from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as several offshore islands along with much of northwest Mayo are recognised Gaeltacht areas. 


As many as 47 offshore islands had permanent populations prior to the Great Famine. Communities had resided on these islands for generations, and their remains can still be seen to this day through the villages, stone walls and lazybeds which they left behind. By the end of the 19th century most of the county's islands had been deserted. In contrast, Achill benefitted from a bridge to the mainland which allowed the population to temporarily rebound, reaching its all-time peak in 1911.


Emigration from the islands continued into the 20th-century as traditional industries such as fishing and textiles were unable to provide an attractive, or in many cases adequate, income to young islanders. In recent times, the islands have become a popular tourist destination and depend heavily on the tourism and hospitality sector. Their population swells during the summer months, particularly on Achill and Clare. Popular activities include surfing, sailing, island-hopping in Clew Bay, spiritual retreats and eco-tourism.


The following table shows population trends for the fourteen currently inhabited islands as of the last census. The overall trend is a continuing decline in the population of Mayo's offshore islands, which is currently at a historic low. The county as a whole was one of just three in Ireland to record a population decrease between 2011 and 2016. The population of Mayo during this time decreased by 0.2%, whereas the population of the islands fell by 5.3%. Although the overall population fell during this time, four previously uninhabited islands received new residents, including Achillbeg, which had been uninhabited since 1965.


With the exception of Achill, County Mayo's islands are generally small in size, with only 13 larger than 100 acres (40Â ha) and 3 larger than 1,000 acres (400Â ha). There are numerous offshore islands in the 10 to 100 acre range, along with at least 15 freshwater islands larger than 10 acres, the largest of which is Illannaglashy on Lough Conn at 82 acres (33Â ha).


The one hundred largest islands in the county are listed below. ""F"" designates a freshwater island. 


County Mayo has hundreds of smaller islands and islets. Most of the county's offshore islands are located in Clew Bay, with smaller clusters located around the Achill archipelago, the west and south coasts of the Mullet Peninsula, and Blacksod Bay. The list below is not exhaustive, and includes named offshore islands that are either extensive (typically greater than 2 acres in area) or in someway locally significant or identifiable. 


Unlike the above list, this list is in alphabetical order and does not include freshwater islands.


There are numerous large loughs within the county, containing hundreds of small freshwater islands. Lough Mask in southern Mayo is the largest lough in the county. At 83Â km2 (21,000 acres) it is the 6th-largest lough in Ireland (as well as the 6th-largest in Britain and Ireland). Further south, Lough Corrib is the 2nd-largest lough in Ireland; however, only a small portion of this lough is located within the county.


Illannaglashy, on Lough Conn, is the largest freshwater island in the county, at 82 acres (33Â ha) in area. Freshwater islands have played an important role in the county's history and host an abundance of castles, monasteries, church ruins and unspoiled woodlands.


Six islands within County Mayo have had a dedicated monastery or abbey established on them. Four of these are offshore, and two of these are freshwater islands. They are listed below:


In addition to the above sites, many more islands within the county have been used for religious purposes. The ruins of old churches and cemeteries can be found scattered across such islands.


Many of the county's offshore and freshwater islands are designated as areas of ecological significance and are protected both at national and European level. Mayo's offshore islands are a haven for wildlife and biodiversity, supporting hundreds of species of bird, fish and marine mammal, as well as unique vegetation. Five of the county's major inland lakes (along with their islands) are also protected, those being Lough Mask, Lough Conn, Lough Cullin, Lough Carra and Carrowmore Lake.


The biodiversity of the islands is protected under the following designations. There is overlap across designations, as different designations apply to different species, e.g. the Duvillaun Islands are an SAC, SPA and proposed NHA. 


The following areas of ecological significance are located either on or adjacent to County Mayo's offshore islands. The five major inland lakes listed as SPAs are also included, and are shown in italics in the list below.

It launched as a basic subscription channel in 1998, under the name L'Ãquipe TV. In late 2012, L'Ãquipe TV became L'Ãquipe 21 and started broadcasting in high definition on France's free digital terrestrial television (DTT). It was rebranded again as just L'Ãquipe in September 2016.


On August 31, 1998, Groupe Amaury launched a television channel spun off from its daily sports newspaper L'Ãquipe. It served as Canalsatellite's sports news channel, and competed with TPS' Infosport.


On March 5, 2012, Groupe Amaury answered an invitation to tender for one of six new high definition DTT channel slots extended by the French television regulatory authority, the CSA. Amaury's proposal to bring its existing L'Equipe TV to the platform, with an increased focus on live events, was backed by the French National Olympic and Sports Committee and the country's horse racing industry against the other bidder, NextRadioTV's RMC Sport HD.


On March 27, 2012, the CSA announced that L'Ãquipe HD (the channel's tentative new name) had been selected for one of the six new slots.[citation needed]


On July 25, 2012, the CSA awarded Channel 21 on the French DTT network, known as TNT (TÃ©lÃ©vision NumÃ©rique Terrestre), to Amaury. To better convey its position on the channel list, L'Ãquipe HD was renamed L'Ãquipe 21 on November 14, 2012.


The channel's TNT relaunch took place on December 12, 2012.[citation needed]
On September 3, 2016, L'Ãquipe 21 was rebranded again as just L'Ãquipe.

Donelli was probably a pupil of Ercole Procaccini the Younger and his training included the study of Daniele Crespiâs frescoes for the Carthusian monastery in Garegnano. Influenced by the painting of the Venetian Tenebrists, possibly through the work of Filippo Abbiati, he worked at first in the provinces (Codogno and Varese) and then on various churches in Milan. While few of Donelliâs works survive, significant evidence of his style is provided by his altarpiece of Saint Anne Offering Mary to the Eternal Father for the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Sorrows in Rho.

40279056,Ivan Toney,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ivan_Toney&action=info,"Ivan Benjamin Elijah Toney (born 16 March 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Brentford.


Toney became the youngest player to represent Northampton Town when he made his first-team debut in 2012, and scored 13 goals in 60 matches across all competitions before joining Newcastle United in 2015. In his first season at Newcastle, he had two loans at Barnsley, winning the Football League Trophy and the League One play-offs. He spent next two years on loan at League One clubs Shrewsbury Town, Scunthorpe United, and Wigan Athletic. 


In 2018, he joined Peterborough United for an undisclosed fee, and was League One top scorer and Player of the Season in 2019â20. He then signed for Brentford, where he set the record for most goals scored in a Championship season, with 31 in the 2020â21 season, in which the team were promoted to the Premier League.


Born in Northampton, Toney began his career at his hometown club Northampton Town. He made his first-team debut on 13 November 2012, in a 3â3 draw in the FA Cup first round away to Bradford City; he came on at the end of regulation time in place of Lewis Wilson as his team eventually lost 4â2 in a penalty shoot-out. At 16 years old he became the youngest first-team player in the club's history. The following day, he scored four goals in the FA Youth Cup, in a 5â0 win over York City. His only other appearance in a matchday squad that season was on 17 November, remaining unused in a 3â1 League Two win at home to Wycombe Wanderers.


Toney made his first start on 28 September 2013 in a goalless home draw against Morecambe, making way for Ben Tozer after 74 minutes. His first professional goals came on 26 April 2014, scoring two in the first half of a 3â0 victory away to Dagenham & Redbridge, the latter a bicycle kick. On 3 May, he scored a header as Northampton defeated Oxford United 3â1 at home to avoid relegation to the Conference Premier on the final day of the season.


On 12 August 2014, Toney scored a header in a 3â2 win away to Championship team Wolverhampton Wanderers in the first round of the League Cup. His first goals of the league season arrived on 20 September; on as a substitute for Lawson D'Ath, he scored twice in a home contest against Accrington Stanley but his team nonetheless lost 5â4. A week later, his header was the only goal in victory away to Morecambe. Toney received the first red card of his career on 26 December in a 3â2 home defeat to Bury, being dismissed for fighting with visiting defender Hayden White.


In November 2014, Toney was close to a transfer to Wolverhampton Wanderers, which collapsed due to an undisclosed medical issue.


After 13 goals in 60 appearances for Northampton across all competitions, Toney signed for Premier League club Newcastle United on 6 August 2015 on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 25 August in the second round of the League Cup, replacing Massadio HaÃ¯dara for the final 12 minutes of a 4â1 home win over his former team. On 26 September, he played his first league match for Newcastle, as an 85th-minute substitute for Aleksandar MitroviÄ in a 2â2 home draw against Chelsea.


On 9 November 2015, Toney joined League One club Barnsley on a 28-day youth loan. He made his debut the next day in the Northern quarter-finals of the Football League Trophy, starting in a 2â1 home win over York. On 5 December, he scored his first goal for Barnsley away to Wigan Athletic in the Trophy's next round, a header in a 2â2 draw, and also converted his attempt as they won in the subsequent penalty shoot-out. A week later, he scored his first league goal for the club, deciding a 3â2 win away to Colchester United with a header from Marley Watkins' cross.


On 24 March 2016, Toney returned to Barnsley on loan for the remainder of the season. On 3 April, in the 2016 Football League Trophy Final against Oxford United at Wembley Stadium, he came on as a 65th-minute substitute for top scorer Sam Winnall. He took a shot which rebounded for Ashley Fletcher to give Barnsley a 2â1 lead, and they eventually won 3â2. Barnsley won promotion with a 3â1 victory over Millwall at the same ground on 29 May; Toney replaced Fletcher for the last nine minutes.


The following season, Toney joined League One club Shrewsbury Town on 8 August 2016 on a half-season loan. He scored his first goal for the club, converting a penalty after being fouled by Charles Dunne, in a 3â2 win away to Oldham Athletic on 3 September, and added another a week later to equalise in a 1â1 draw away to Bury. On 24 September, he was sent off in a 1â1 draw away to AFC Wimbledon for a late challenge on opposition goalkeeper James Shea.


Having scored 7 goals in 26 appearances across all competitions for Shrewsbury, Toney was loaned to fellow League One club Scunthorpe United on 12 January 2017 for the remainder of the 2016â17 season. Two days later he made his debut for the Iron, replacing Kevin van Veen for the final ten minutes of a 2â1 win on his return to Northampton. On 28 January, he made a first start and scored in a 3â2 home win over Port Vale, putting Scunthorpe in first place.


On 2 August 2017, Toney returned to League One, joining Wigan Athletic for the upcoming season. He made his debut three days later, starting as they began the campaign with a 1â0 win away to Milton Keynes Dons. His first goal for his new team came on 19 August, opening a 2â0 win away to Oldham Athletic. However, his deal was cut short, as he returned to Newcastle on 10 January 2018.


Toney re-signed on loan for Scunthorpe United on 11 January 2018. He scored his first goal back in a Scunthorpe shirt on 3 February 2018, netting the winner in a 3â2 away victory over Fleetwood Town.


Toney signed for League One club Peterborough United on 9 August 2018 on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee, reported by some sources as Â£650,000. He made his debut two days later in a 4â1 win at Rochdale as a 72nd-minute substitute for two-goal Jason Cummings. On 8 September, coming on for the same player, he scored his first goal for the Posh to win 3â2 at Southend United.


He scored a hat-trick on 11 December in a 4â4 draw in the second round replay of the FA Cup away to Bradford City â starting with a free kick from near the halfway line â but missed in the subsequent penalty shootout although his team won nonetheless. Eighteen days later he recorded another treble in a 4â0 win at Accrington Stanley. On 23 February 2019, Toney was sent off in the first half-hour of a 2â1 home loss to former team Shrewsbury, for handling the ball on the goal line.


Toney began the 2019â20 season with seven goals in the first seven league games, concluding with a hat-trick in a 6â0 home win over Rochdale on 14 September. The following month, he asked a chant sung by Peterborough fans about the size of his genitalia to be changed to make it more family-friendly.


Toney scored nine times in his last seven games before the season was abandoned in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was voted Player of the Season at the EFL Awards.


On 31 August 2020, Toney completed a medical and signed for Championship club Brentford on a five-year deal. The fee was reported to be in the region of Â£5 million and around Â£10 million with add-ons, Peterborough's record transfer fee. Among the other clubs to want him was Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, but only as a back-up to Harry Kane. He scored his first goal for Brentford, a penalty, in a 1â1 draw with Millwall on 26 September; in each of his next three games, he scored twice.


On 20 January 2021, Toney assisted the only goal of a home win over Luton Town, before being dismissed in added time for an altercation with Tom Lockyer. Ten days later, he contributed a hat-trick to a 7â2 win over Wycombe Wanderers, also at the Brentford Community Stadium. In April, he was nominated for the EFL Championship Player of the Season.


On 8 May 2021, Toney scored his 31st league goal of the season against Bristol City, setting a new Championship record for most goals scored in a single season. Three weeks later, he scored in a 2â0 win over Swansea City in the 2021 EFL Championship play-off Final.


While at Brentford, the club stopped taking a knee against racism; Toney said that players were being ""used as puppets"" to make the gesture while society did not change. He also faced online racist abuse over the season. Following Brentford's decision to take the knee for the 2020â21 Premier League season alongside the other 19 clubs, Toney said he would not join his colleagues and would continue to stand.


On 13 August 2021, Toney started and played the full game in Brentfordâs first Premier League match, where they won 2â0 over Arsenal.


In March 2021, it was reported that Toney would be called up to the Jamaican national team, as part of a plan by the Jamaican Football Federation to purposely target a number of English-born players for call ups to increase the nation's chances of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. Jamaican Football Federation president Michael Ricketts claimed that Toney was in the process of acquiring a Jamaican passport in order to play for the nation. Despite this, Toney reportedly rejected Jamaica's call, as he harboured an ambition to represent his country of birth.

46878774,Tim Cook,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Cook&action=info,"Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960) is an American business executive who has been the chief executive officer of Apple Inc. since 2011. Cook previously served as the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs.


Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then served as the executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations. He was made the chief executive on August 24, 2011, prior to Jobs' death in October of that year. During his tenure as the chief executive, he has advocated for the political reformation of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since 2011 when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook doubled the company's revenue and profit, and the company's market value increased from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion.


In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay. Cook also serves on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc. and the National Football Foundation, and is a trustee of Duke University. Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy, and in March 2015, he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity.


Cook was born in Mobile, Alabama, United States. He was baptized in a Baptist church and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine, worked at a pharmacy.


Cook graduated from Robertsdale High School in 1978. He earned a Bachelor of Science in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982, and his Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business in 1988.


After graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent 12 years in IBM's personal computer business, ultimately serving as the director of North American fulfillment. During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988. Later, he served as the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics. In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq for six months, but left the position after being hired by Steve Jobs.


In 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:


Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.

His first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations. Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from ""cast-off, reject iPad parts"". Cook's actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.


In January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations and served as chief executive in 2009, while Jobs was away on a leave of absence for health-related issues. In January 2011, Apple's board of directors approved a third medical leave of absence requested by Jobs. During that time, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs made most major decisions.


After Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named the new chief executive officer of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011. Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from pancreatic cancer. Forbes contributor Robin Ferracone wrote in September 2011: ""Jobs and Cook proceeded to forge a strong partnership, and rescued the company from its death spiral, which took it from $11 billion in revenue in 1995 down to less than $6 billion in 1998 ... Under their leadership, the company went from its nadir to a remarkable $100 billion today"". In April 2012, Time included Cook on its annual ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" list.


On October 29, 2012, Cook made major changes to the company's executive team. Scott Forstall resigned as senior vice president of iOS, and became an advisor to Cook until he eventually departed from the company in 2013. John Browett, who was senior VP of retail, was dismissed six months after he commenced at Apple, when he received 100,000 shares worth US$60 million. Forstall's duties were divided among four other Apple executives: design SVP Jony Ive assumed leadership of Apple's human interface team; Craig Federighi became the new head of iOS software engineering; services chief Eddy Cue became responsible for Maps and Siri; and Bob Mansfield, previously SVP of hardware engineering, became the head of a new technology group.


Cook made the executive changes after the third quarter of the fiscal year, when revenues and profits grew less than predicted. One commentator said that Forstall was forced to step down, as Cook ""decided to lance the boil as internal politics and dissent reached a key pitch"". Since becoming CEO, Cook focused upon building a harmonious culture that meant ""weeding out people with disagreeable personalitiesâpeople Jobs tolerated and even held close, like Forstall"", although another journalist said, ""Apple's ability to innovate came from tension and disagreement."" On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to ""get out of the stock"" if they did not share the company's views on sustainability and climate change. In May 2016, Cook traveled to China to meet with government officials there after the closure of Apple's online iTunes Store and Apple Books store by the Chinese government.


In 2016 some analysts compared Cook to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, claiming that innovation had died down since he replaced Jobs, similar to when Ballmer became Microsoft CEO in 2000. In December 2017, Cook was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China.


Cook was appointed chairman of the advisory board for Tsinghua University's economics school in October 2019 for a three-year term.


Rep. Tom Malinowski, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and several other lawmakers criticized Cook over Apple's decision to remove an app used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong from its App Store. They accused Apple of censorship and co-signed a letter to Cook that read, ""Apple's decisions last week to accommodate the Chinese government by taking down HKMaps is deeply concerning. We urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong."" Cook explained in an internal letter why the company removed Hong Kong mapping app used by protesters to coordinate movements.


In August 2021, Cook received an approximate $750m payout, selling more than five million shares in Apple, after marking ten years in the job.


Alongside Google Vice President Vint Cerf and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Cook attended a summit held by President Barack Obama on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the Internet in the wake of the Edward Snowden NSA incident.


Following the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 people were killed by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the Federal Bureau of Investigation solicited Apple to assist in ""unlock[ing]"" an iPhone 5C used by Farook. On February 16, 2016, in response to a request by the Department of Justice, a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to create a custom iOS firmware version that would allow investigators to circumvent the phone's security features. Cook responded in an open letter, wherein he denounced the government's demands as constituting a ""breach of privacy"" with ""chilling"" consequences.


As Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30Â am, and previously held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week. Cook shared in May 2013 that his leadership focused on people, strategy, and execution; he explained, ""If you get those three right the world is a great place."" Under Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its donations to charity, and in 2013, he hired Lisa Jackson, formerly the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.


During the 2008 election cycle, Cook donated to Barack Obama's first White House election.


While it had been reported in early 2011 that Cook was gay, at the time, and prior to his Oct. 2014 public statement, Cook chose to keep his personal life private. He did publicly support LGBT rights. In October 2014, the Alabama Academy of Honor inducted Cook, who spoke about his home state's record of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights. The Academy of Honor is the highest honor Alabama gives its citizens.


In 2015, Cook said he donated to Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Patrick Leahy for their stances on eBook pricing and surveillance reform, respectively. During the same election cycle, he hosted a fundraiser for Republican Senator Rob Portman.


In early March 2016, Cook disclosed that he donated to the election campaign of Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. In early June, Cook hosted a private fundraiser along with then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan. The event was described by Politico as ""a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans"".


In the 2016 election, Cook raised funds for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. At one point, Clinton's campaign considered Cook as a candidate for Vice President.


In September 2017 at Bloomberg's Global Business Forum, Cook defended the DACA immigration program. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of Donald Trump's administration, stating: ""This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this.""


In 2018, at a privacy conference in Brussels, Cook expressed his opinions on the stockpiling of personal data by tech firms, suggesting that it amounted to surveillance and should make the public ""very uncomfortable.""


In a meeting for the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board with President Donald Trump in March 2019, Trump referred to Cook as ""Tim Apple"". Cook leaned into the slip-up by changing his display name on Twitter to Tim Apple while Trump denied that he had said it.


Cook is a fitness enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. He is known for being solitary, using an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and little is publicly shared about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a ""basic level of privacy"".


Cook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996, an incident he said made him ""see the world in a different way"". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. He later told the Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms came from ""lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around"".


Cook has said that in 2009 he offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, as they shared a rare blood type. Cook said that Jobs responded by yelling, ""I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that.""


While delivering the 2010 commencement speech at Auburn, Cook emphasized the importance of intuition during significant decision-making processes, and explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.


In June 2014, Cook attended San Francisco's gay pride parade along with a delegation of Apple staff. On October 30, Cook publicly came out as gay in an editorial for Bloomberg Business, saying, ""I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me."" He consulted with Anderson Cooper, who had publicly come out himself, on aspects of the statement, and cleared the timing to ensure it would not distract from business interests. Cook had been open about his sexuality ""for years"", and while many people at the company were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended his op-ed by writing, ""We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick."" Cook became the first and only openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 list. In September 2015, Cook clarified on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ""Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth."" In October 2019, he talked about the decision and remarked on how it was thanks to LGBTQ people who had fought for their rights before him that paved the way for his success, and that he needed to let younger generations know thatâin a coding analogyâhe saw being gay as a feature his life had to offer rather than any problem. He hoped his openness could help LGBTQ youth dealing with homelessness and suicide hope that their situation could get better.",8,11 April 2005, 19 September 2021,"2,723",5,4

1699889,Signifyin',https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signifyin%27,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Signifyin'&action=info,"Signifyin' (sometimes written ""signifyin(g)"") (vernacular), is a wordplay. It is a practice in African-American culture involving a verbal strategy of indirection that exploits the gap between the denotative and figurative meanings of words. A simple example would be insulting someone to show affection.  Other names for signifyin' include:  ""Dropping lugs, joaning, sounding, capping, snapping, dissing, busting, bagging, janking, ranking, toasting, woofing, putting on, or cracking.""


Signifyin' directs attention to the connotative, context-bound significance of words, which is accessible only to those who share the cultural values of a given speech community. The expression comes from stories about the signifying monkey, a trickster figure said to have originated during slavery in the United States.


The American literary critic Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote in The Signifying Monkey (1988) that signifyin' is ""a trope, in which are subsumed several other rhetorical tropes, including metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony (the master tropes), and also hyperbole, litotes, and metalepsis. To this list we could easily add aporia, chiasmus, and catachresis, all of which are used in the ritual of Signifyin(g).""


Rudy Ray Moore, known as ""Dolemite"", is well-known for having used the term in his comedic performances. While signifyin(g) is the term coined by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. to represent a black vernacular, the idea stems from the thoughts of Ferdinand De Saussure and the process of signifyingâ""the association between words and the ideas they indicate."" Gates states, ""'Signification,' in standard English, denotes the meaning that a term conveys, or is intended to convey."" Gates takes this idea of signifying and ""doubles"" it in order to explain signifyin(g). He states of black vernacular, ""their complex act of language Signifies upon both formal language use and its conventions, conventions established, at least officially, by middle-class white people.""


Gates examines the ways in which signifyin(g) differs from signifying.


According to Gates, the practice derived from the trickster archetype found in much African mythology, folklore, and religion: a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who plays tricks or otherwise disobeys normal rules and societal norms. In practice, signifyin' often takes the form of quoting from sub-cultural vernacular, while extending the meaning at the same time through a rhetorical figure.


The expression itself derives from the numerous tales about the signifying monkey, a folk trickster figure said to have originated during slavery in the United States. In most of these narratives, the monkey manages to dupe the powerful lion by signifying.


The term signifyin' itself currently carries a range of metaphorical and theoretical meanings in black cultural studies that stretch far beyond its literal scope of reference. In The Signifying Monkey, Gates expands the term to refer not merely to a specific vernacular strategy but also to a trope of double-voiced repetition and reversal that exemplifies the distinguishing property of black discourse. However, this subtle African-American device, if linguistically analyzed, becomes notoriously difficult to pin down, as Gates writes:


Thinking about the black concept of Signifiyin(g) is a bit like stumbling unaware into a hall of mirrors: the sign itself appears to be doubled, at the very least, and (re)doubled upon ever closer examination. It is not the sign itself, however, which has multiplied. If orientation prevails over madness, we soon realize that only the signifier has been doubled and (re)doubled, a signifier in this instance that is silent, a ""sound-image"" as Saussure defines the signifier, but a ""sound-image"" sans the sound. The difficulty that we experience when thinking about the nature of the visual (re)doubling at work in a hall of mirrors is analogous to the difficulty we shall encounter in relating the black linguistic sign, ""Signification,"" to the standard English sign, ""signification."" This level of conceptual difficulty stems fromâindeed, seems, to have been intentionally inscribed withinâthe selection of the signifier, ""signification."" For the standard English word is a homonym of the Afro-American vernacular word. And, to compound the dizziness and giddiness that we must experience in the vertiginous movement between these two ""identical"" signifiers, these two homonyms have everything to do with each other and, then again, absolutely nothing.


Gates, in ""The Signifying Monkey and the Language of Signifyin(g)"" clarifies the confusing nature of the subject matter by representing the two terms on a graph made up of intercepting x-axis and a y-axis.  The x-axis is represented by the standard English that white people recognize and use within most professional and educational settings.  Simply put, the x-axis is the literal definition of a word as represented by the masses and the term coined by Saussure.  The y-axis, however, is represented by the term signifyin(g) and is labelled as ""black vernacular.""  As Gates represents, ""the relation of signification itself has been critiqued by a black act of (re)doubling"" in which the point of intersection permits new understandings of a term to take place. Where the x-axis and y-axis intersect, the two meanings of the word collide to form a new meaning, so often represented by puns and tropes.


By viewing signifyin(g) as a graph, such as Gates represents, the doubling nature of black vernacular becomes apparent.  As Gates exhibits, ""the English-language use of signification refers to the chain of signifiers that configures horizontally,"" or all accepted definitions of a term as represented by standard English.  The y-axis of black vernacular, however, ""concerns itself with that which is suspended, vertically...the playful puns on a word that occupy the paradigmatic axis of language and which a speaker draws on for figurative substitution."" A term may share a name but the definitions may be completely different.


An example of signifyin' is ""playing the dozens"". The dozens is a game in which participants seek to outdo each other by throwing insults back and forth. Tom Kochman offered as an example in Rappin' and Stylin' Out: Communication in Urban Black America (1972): ""Yo momma sent her picture to the lonely hearts club, but they sent it back and said, 'We ain't that lonely!'""


Caponi describes ""calls, cries, hollers, riffs, licks, overlapping antiphony"" as examples of signifying in hip hop music and other African-American music. She explains that signifyin' differs from simple repetition and from simple variation in that it uses material:


rhetorically or figurativelyâthrough troping, in other wordsâby trifling with, teasing, or censuring it in some way. Signifyin(g) is also a way of demonstrating respect for, goading, or poking fun at a musical style, process, or practice through parody, pastische, implication, indirection, humor, tone- or word-play, the illusions of speech, or narration, and other troping mechanisms... Signifyin(g) shows, among other things, either reverence or irreverence toward previously stated musical statements and values.""

Schloss relates this to the ambiguity common to African musics, including looping (as of a sample), for ""it allows individuals to demonstrate intellectual power while simultaneously obscuring the nature and extent of their agency ... It allows producers to use other people's music to convey their own compositional ideas"".


Several academics have argued that ""black Twitter"" has become a form of signifyin'. Sarah Florini of the University of Wisconsin-Madison writes that race is normally tied to ""corporeal signifiers."" Online, in the absence of the body, black users perform their racial identity using wordplay that only those with knowledge of black culture can fully recognize.


Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, recognized as the first scholar to interject African American women's signifyin' practices into broader linguistic discourses, recorded the following example.  Grace is pregnant and beginning to show, but has not informed her sister yet.  Her sister, seemingly unaware of the situation, comments on her weight gain:  ""Grace (noncommittally): Yes, I guess I am putting on a little weight. Rochelle: Now look here, girl, we both standing here soaking wet and you still trying to tell me it ainât raining?""


In their article ""Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Current Debate in African-American Literary Criticism, An Introduction"", Roger Matuz and Cathy Falk explore the criticism that the term signifyin(g) has faced since its introduction in Gates text, The Signifying Monkey: a Theory of African-American Literary Criticism.  The main criticism that Gates faces is a confusion surrounding the ideas of a black literary theory informed by Western thoughtâthe same thought that created a purpose for the term signifyin(g). Gates responds to these critiques by arguing for ""text specific readings of black literature that explore works in relation to themselves and each other rather than viewing them as literal reflections of historical or social aspects of African American society."" This conversation between texts is the redoubling that comprises signifyin(g).


Joyce A. Joyce states that Gates is too far removed from the black experience: ""Black creative art is an act of love which attempts to destroy estrangement and elitism by demonstrating a strong fondness or enthusiasm for freedom and an affectionate concern for the life of people, especially black people... It should be the job of the Black literary critic to force ideas to the surface, to give them force in order to affect, to guide, to animate and to arouse the minds and emotions of black people.""


Other critics, however, support Gates and the term signifyin(g), noting its ""subversive"" nature and ability to bring about change to a system.",3,6 April 2005, 1 September 2021,211,2,1

The design was built by Regatta Plastics Co. in Houston, Texas, United States, but it is now out of production.


The Baymaster 18 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig, a raked stem, an angled transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed keel with a centerboard. It displaces 850Â lb (386Â kg) and carries 150Â lb (68Â kg) of ballast.


The boat has a draft of 4.00Â ft (1.22Â m) with the centerboard extended and 9Â in (23Â cm) with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer.


The boat is normally fitted with a small 2 to 5Â hp (1 to 4Â kW) outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.


The design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double berth in the cabin, and two in the cockpit under a boom tent. Cabin headroom is 39Â in (99Â cm).


The design has a hull speed of 5.2Â kn (9.6Â km/h).


In a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, ""The designer's intent was to place emphasis on safety and stability. Perhaps not surprisingly considering this, he has kept the main performance parameters (displacement, D/L, SA/D,) in the middle of the comp[etition] group.

That's not necessarily bad: we have met people who like to sleep four in a closet. In any case, she has the look of a classic little sailer and we suspect sails well. though we have never seen one sailing.

Through the 2015 edition, the tournament took place every two years and was also a qualifying tournament for the FIBA World Cup and the Olympic basketball tournament. However, since 2017, the tournament was renamed the FIBA Asia Cup and now includes teams from FIBA Oceania. Also, it was the first to be played on a new four-year cycle, and is no longer a part of the qualifying process for the World Cup or the Olympics.


The Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) Championship was inaugurated in Manila in 1960. The championship was held to find Asia's best team and for qualification to the World Championship and the Olympics. On the next four tournaments, the Philippines won 3 with the Japanese beating the Filipinos on 1965. Korea, Japan and the Philippines split the next 3 championships until China debuted on 1975 at Bangkok with the championship, where they've dominated ever since.


From 1975 to 2007, there were only two instances where China did not win the championship. In 1985, the Philippines defeated a full-strength Chinese team, which were by then five-time defending champions, in the championship round. The Chinese then won every game in the championship until 1997, where they to lost to South Korea in the semi-finals where they complained about the climate in Riyadh.[citation needed] The Koreans beat the Japanese in the final, but the Chinese would then start a championship streak of four tournaments, led by Yao Ming.


By 2005, the tournament had been renamed as the FIBA Asia Championship; in that year's tournament in Doha, the Chinese easily won against the Lebanese in the final. During the 2007 Championship, the Chinese did not send their ""A"" team since they had already qualified to the Olympics by virtue of hosting it. In this championship, West Asian teams started to compete with the traditional East Asian powers, as evidenced of an all-West Asian final when Iran defeated Lebanon. In 2009, Iran defeated the Chinese team A in the 2009 final to become only the 3rd team to successfully defend the championship. The 2009 championship started a streak of finals contested between a team from the Middle East and a team from the Far East; in 2011, Iran was eliminated by Jordan in the quarterfinals, which would then lose to hosts China by one point in the final. The 2013 Championship would be the first to be hosted outside East Asia since 2005 in the Philippines, the hosts, emerged as finalists; China had been eliminated by Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals, which were then defeated by the Iranians, who then beat the Filipinos in the Final.


As FIBA implemented a new cycle and tournament format, the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship held in Manila and the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship held in Changsha were the last Asian Championships to serve as qualification to either the FIBA Basketball World Cup and the Olympic Games.
The 2017 FIBA Asia Championship will mark firsts and lasts for the Asian Championship, as it will be the first Asian Championship as a standalone tournament, meaning it will not serve as the qualifier for either the Basketball World Cup or the Olympic Games.  The 2017 Tournament was the last Asian Championships to be ever held, and under a 2-year cycle. After 2017, the Asian Championships and the FIBA Oceania Championship will merge into a one tournament to be known as the FIBA Asia Cup. It will be held every 4 years like the EuroBasket, AfroBasket and AmeriCup, which are held 2 years before/after the FIBA World Cup.


Qualification is via the different FIBA Asia subzones. The East, Gulf, Southeast and West subzones receive two berths each, while the Central and South zones get one each. The host and the champion from the preceding FIBA Asia Cup also get a berth each. Each subzone conducts a qualification tournament up to a year before the championship to determine the qualifying teams. The other four berths are distributed to the subzones in reference to their performance in the previous year's FIBA Asia Cup, with the subzone receiving an extra berth for each team in the top four excluding the champion and the host.


There had been a variety of tournament formats used before. Most were similar to the format of two group stages and a knockout stage. The current format, as first applied in 2017, is a multistage tournament. The 16 teams are grouped in four groups in the preliminary round. The teams play against each other once; the top team will directly advance to the quarterfinals, and the second placed teams will play an elimination game between the third placed team of another group. The four winning teams of the elimination games will advance to the quarterfinals. After the elimination games, the knock-out phase will follow.


The classification games will be conducted as follows:

It is near the village of Carrington, Greater Manchester, England, and replaced The Cliff as the club's training ground in 2000. Construction on the complex began in 1999, the main building was opened and the first team moved in in 2000, followed in 2002 by the Academy facility, home to the club's renowned youth system. In 2013, major additions were completed at the complex, including a medical centre and sports science department.[citation needed]


At the end of the 1990s, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson felt that the club's training ground, The Cliff (which had been in use since 1938), was inadequate as the Premier League entered the 21st century. Ferguson was also unhappy about the lack of privacy at The Cliff, with journalists present on a daily basis, opposition team scouts able to watch training sessions, and supporters asking for autographs and photographs with players. The club's board set about finding a new location for their training ground, and purchased more than 100 acres of secluded land in Carrington â less than 10 miles (16Â km) from Old Trafford stadium â with a vision to transform it into a world-class sports training facility. Construction began in 1999, with a budget of Â£22Â million, of which Â£14Â million was spent on the Main Building (first team) which opened in the summer of 2000, and a further Â£8Â million spent on the Academy Facility, opening in the summer of 2002. A new Â£25Â million medical and sports science facility was constructed on the grounds in 2013. This brought the total cost of construction to over Â£60Â million. Approximately 300 people work at Carrington on a daily basis.


The Main Building, which houses the Manchester United first team, was opened in the pre-season of 2000. It comprises two levels. The ground floor includes; a large gymnasium, indoor running tracks, rehabilitation training hall, squash and basketball courts, weights room, 25-metre swimming pool, remedial and hydrotherapy pools, spa pool, jacuzzi, underwater treadmills, sauna and steam rooms, sunbeds (for Vitamin D), yoga rooms, administration and executive offices, seven team changing rooms, staff changing rooms, laundry rooms and five kit/boot rooms. The first floor includes; the first team manager's office (overlooking outdoor training pitches), manager's personal assistant office, assistant manager's office, coaches offices, match and opposition analysis suite, physiotherapy treatment rooms (with 10 physio beds), massage rooms, first aid station, doctor's office, physio's office (overlooking swimming pools, rehab hall, and weight room), classrooms, conference rooms, charity staff offices (Manchester United Foundation), restaurant seating over 100 people, player's lounge, recreation and games rooms, as well as an elevated, covered viewing gallery overlooking the outdoor pitches. The Main Building was extended and updated in 2013.


The Academy Facility, which houses the Manchester United Football Club Under-21s, was opened in the close-season of 2002 by club legend Sir Bobby Charlton, himself a product of the club's prestigious Academy. The Academy Facility comprises two levels. The ground floor includes; a full-size indoor football pitch with a synthetic AstroTurf surface, a full-size outdoor football pitch with heated and floodlit AstroTurf surface (built to specifications of the pitch at Old Trafford), 11 dressing rooms for; youth teams, coaches and referees, coaches briefing rooms, kit/boot room, player treatment facility and physio's office. The first floor includes; indoor viewing balcony overlooking indoor pitch, outdoor viewing balcony overlooking outdoor pitches, visitors and parents lounge, staff training rooms and an MUTV television studio. Manchester United Soccer Schools also use the Academy Facility, and young students can avail of education facilities at the ground.


In 2012, work began on a new Â£25Â million medical facility at the site. It was completed in early 2013, and includes a state-of-the-art hospital wing and sports science department for treating player injuries and assisting in recuperation, with treatment rooms and offices for; doctors, physiotherapists, sports scientists, sports psychologists, statisticians and dieticians. The facility was supplied with Â£13Â million worth of medical equipment by Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, as part of their sponsorship with the club, and the medical centre is fitted with x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound scanners, as well as other high-tech screening equipment normally reserved for hospitals.


The site covers a total area of 108 acres (440,000Â m2), of which 85 acres are used by the club. On the grounds, there are a total of 14 football pitches of varying sizes; 12 of which are grass pitches (with drainage, irrigation sprinklers, under-soil heating and floodlights), one full-size outdoor floodlit and heated AstroTurf all-weather pitch, one full-size indoor floodlit and heated AstroTurf artificial pitch and a special goalkeeper training area. Desso GrassMaster playing surfaces are used, the same surface as the pitch at Old Trafford. There is a helipad at the structure. The unused 23 acres of remaining land includes a small nature reserve, maintained by the club and the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. There are two ponds which are used as part of the waste water treatment system.


Carrington is considered one of the most secretive and secure sports training facilities in Europe. The media and locals have dubbed the complex ""Fortress Carrington"", due to the security measures in place at the grounds. There is a 2.4 kilometres (1.5Â mi) long, 8 metre (26 feet) high security wall, video surveillance cameras, intrusion detection systems, and over 30,000 trees have been planted surrounding the site, rendering it impossible to see into the premises. The complex is staffed 24/7 by a security team, who conduct roaming patrols, in order to prevent members of the media and opposition spies from gaining access to team practice sessions for upcoming matches. Fans are prohibited from entering the facility, and are also banned from requesting autographs and photographs from professional players outside it. During the season, the media is allowed into the complex only once a week when the manager briefs the press before games, and they are only ever allowed to take photographs and videos of the team training ahead of home Champions League or Europa League fixtures â due to UEFA regulations â and for just 15 minutes. There are no road signs or markings indicating the existence of the complex. There are a number of entrances into the complex, all guarded by security barriers and protected by security staff. There is also a helipad at the training ground, used for player medicals and transfers, and by the club's owners, the Glazer family.


In April 2013, Manchester United announced an eight-year naming rights agreement with Aon plc that would see the Trafford Training Centre renamed as the Aon Training Complex until 2021. The deal has been estimated to be worth Â£180Â million (Â£22.5Â million per-year), three times the club's outlay on the training complex itself (Â£60Â million). Toshiba Medical Systems, as part of their five-year sponsorship agreement with the club, provided Â£13Â million of medical systems to the complex in 2013.",34,9 September 2007, 24 September 2021,360,2,2

Petty wrote the song and recorded a demo version with his previous band Mudcrutch in 1974. At one point he strongly considered giving the song to The J. Geils Band because he thought it had their sound. During the Damn the Torpedoes sessions he was convinced by producer Jimmy Iovine to include it on the album because he sensed it would be a hit. Billboard Magazine praised the song for its ""strong lyrical hook backed up by some solid mid to fast rock instrumentation"" and its ""urgent"" vocal.

The team plays in the French League and internationally in the Basketball Champions League.


In 1928, French businessmen, LÃ©opold GouloumÃ©s arrived at the city Mans and founded the food association: the SociÃ©tÃ© des Comptoirs Modernes. Like many other industries at the time, him and Bernard Gasnal, founded their own sport club called Goulou Club in 1938. But in September 1939 the Second World War broke out and the men were needed to fight. With the male absent, women decided to persuade the Goulou Club into creating a basketball team for them.


In 1941, the French government prohibited sport clubs to use the name of an industry so the Goulou Club changed its name to Modern Sporting Club.


In 1952, Le Mans frills won the title of champions of France. Then following that success Bernard Gasnal founded a men's team. In 1963 the team joined the elite.


The following years from 1969 to 1970 was very successful, they won the French Cup in 1964 and the French League championship in 1978 and 1979.


After the euphoria of the European games, the club was struggling to survive due to the rising dominance of CSP Limoges and Pau-Orthez


The SCM existed after the MSB was created and was concerned about the amateur part of the association.


The 2008â2009 season will be more prosperous for the club. In addition to a third place in the regular season followed by a semi-final playoffs (defeated against Orleans), the MSB makes a superb double in gleaning the week of ""As"" (74-64 victory facing Orleans in the final) then the French Cup (79-65 victory against Nancy in the Final at Bercy). Best of all, Alain Koffi, whom formed the club, is elected the French MVP of the season. However, in Euroleague, the MSB finished again last in their group with two thin victories in ten games.


Despite the departure of several executives in the off season such as Alain Koffi or Nicolas Batum, the MSB plays always the leading roles in the league in 2009 â 2010 because after having a long time to be the first of the regular season, the club finally finished behind Cholet. The two teams meet in the championship final, but Cholet wins the derby at the top (81-65). Le Mans compete in the Eurocup but are eliminated on the wire in the first round. In 2014, the MSB won the Cup leaders.


Since the 21st of May in 2014, the MSB has been trained by Turkish Erman Kunter, former coach of Cholet. He took over succession from JD Jackson.
The season is mixed, particularly marked by a heavy defeat in the derby home against Cholet Basket (61-82). Committed in Eurochallenge, the MSB won their first two games against the Belgians from Antwerp Giants (72-66) and Finland KTP Basket (71-52) before a heavy on the floor of Pallacanestro Biella, Italian D2 club ( 82â64).


The company was founded on September 6, 1993 as a Society of Mixed Economy Sports Local and chaired until June 30, 2008 by Jean-Pierre Goisbault. Christophe Le Bouille became president on July 1, 2008. In 2007 The company had a budget of 5.5 million euros.


Furthermore, another structure dedicated to marketing, is also under the name of MSB Promotion. It is she who is responsible for the communication around the club's image.


The jersey worn by the players are tango and gray. Tango is inherited from the ancient Moderne Sporting Club.


The logo has existed since 1993 and the acquisition of the new professional status of the team. It uses the colors of the club, accompanied by three letters MSB (acronym of Le Mans Sarthe Basket) written in white. In the summer of 2009, the MSB changed the coat of arms and opted for a lion showing claws and out of the logo, symbol of the feline. The addition of an animal blasonnant the team who follow the custom of other French teams like Pau Orthez and Nancy.


The official group of supporters are called the felines. This exists in the form of an association and follows the club on certain displacements. They even give a reward to the most outstanding players called the reflection feline.


The western derby opposes the two best clubs in the north west of France. Since 1986, it opposed every season of the Le Mans team to that of Cholet, located in Maine-et-Lorie. Since their first encounter in N1B male division, the two teams met regularly. They deliver from the 1990â91 season, a diligent and annual duel. That makes twenty years that the two teams have met each season. The former North West derby was more ""balanced"" and opposed the SC Le Mans at ABC Nantes. The two teams are in particular the two favorites of the trophy, Sarthe Pays de la Loire Basketball where often a first division outsider is invited.

She was the mother of Emperor Go-Toba.


Fujiwara no Shokushi was born in 1157. Her father was BÅmon NobutakaÂ [ja], and her mother was Fujiwara no KyÅ«shi (è¤åä¼å­).


While serving Taira no Tokuko, the daughter of Taira no Kiyomori and wife of Emperor Takakura, she became naishi-no-sukeÂ [ja] (""Assistant Handmaid"") to the emperor, and bore Prince MorisadaÂ [ja] and the future Emperor Go-Toba. In KenkyÅ« 1 (1190), she was of the Junior Third Rank and held the title of jusangÅ«Â [ja], she became a nyoinÂ [ja] and took the title ShichijÅ-in (ä¸æ¡é¢). She took Buddhist orders in GenkyÅ« 2 (1205), taking the dharma name Shinnyochi (çå¦æº). According to the GukanshÅ, her niece (by her younger brother Fujiwara no Nobukiyo) married the third Kamakura shÅgun, Minamoto no Sanetomo.


She inherited a large amount of property (nyoin-ryÅ), which were known as ShichijÅ-in-ryÅ (ä¸æ¡é¢é ).


Shokushi died on the 16th day of the ninth month of Antei 2 (15 October 1228 in the Julian calendar). After her death, the ShichijÅ-in-ryÅ would have passed to her son Go-Toba, but he was in exile on Oki, so under his will they were passed to his concubine Fujiwara no JÅ«shiÂ [ja]'s son Emperor Juntoku's son Prince YoshimuneÂ [ja] instead.


Like many Japanese noblewomen from the classical and medieval periods, the original reading for her given name is uncertain. Shokushi uses the on-yomi of the kanji for her name. This was read by the Japanologist Richard Ponsonby-Fane as ""Masuko"" but by historian Tomohiko OkanoÂ [ja] as ""Taneko"".",6,29 November 2018, 24 August 2021,25,0,0

It is nocturnal and mainly arboreal and is found in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of ""least concern"".


The Malayan field rat has a head-and-body length of 140 to 190Â mm (5.5 to 7.5Â in) and a tail 150 to 200Â mm (6 to 8Â in). It has a weight of between 55 and 150Â g (2 and 5Â oz). The ears are large and nearly naked. The fur is smooth and flattened, interspersed with short spines. The dorsal pelage is a grizzled olive-brown with scattered medium-length black guard hairs, and the underparts are whitish. The tail, which is a similar length to the body, is a uniform dark brown. The feet are broad, and the soles have fine ridges for climbing. It differs from Annandale's rat (Rattus annandalei) in having sleek fur with spines and fewer mammae, and from the ricefield rat (Rattus argentiventer) in having plain white underparts and lacking an orange spot in front of the ear.


The Malayan field rat is known from Malaysia, Thailand, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines and many smaller islands. Its typical habitat is primary and secondary forest, including coastal forest but it is seldom found in dipterocarp forests. It is also found in plantations, shrubby areas, grassland and gardens, but seldom invades buildings.


The Malayan field rat is nocturnal. It climbs well and spends much of its time in trees as well as foraging on the ground. It hides in log piles, heaps of palm fronds, under fallen logs and in the crowns of palm trees. It feeds on both vegetable and animal matter, with oil palm fruits forming part of its diet.


The Malayan field rat is an abundant and adaptable species with a very wide range, a large total population and an ability to live in a number of different environments. No particular threats have been identified, and in some areas it is regarded as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of ""least concern"".

He supported the Royalist cause in the Civil War.


Uvedale was the son of William Uvedale of Wickham and his wife Mary Norton, daughter of Sir Richard Norton. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford on 17 March 1598 aged 16. In 1600 he was a student of the Inner Temple. He was knighted on 19 November 1613.


In May 1605 he attended the Earl of Hertford's embassy to Brussels. In 1614 he was elected Member of Parliament for Hampshire.  His father died in 1616 and he eventually inherited the estates on the death of his mother before 1626.


In January 1618 he acted with other courtiers at Theobalds led by Sir John Finet in an interlude featuring ""Tom of Bedlam the Tinker"" intended to amuse King James who was suffering from gout. The cast included: Thomas Dutton, Thomas Badger, George Goring, Thomas Tyringham, Edward Zouch, Robert Yaxley, Arthur Lake, and George Garret. The King was displeased by the play, especially the lyrics sung by Finet, and John Chamberlain was surprised that ""none had the judgement to see how unfit it was to bring such beastly gear in public before a prince.""


In 1621 he was elected MP for Newport (Isle of Wight). He was elected MP for Portsmouth in 1624. In 1625 he was elected MP for Petersfield. He was re-elected MP for Petersfield  in 1626 and 1628, sitting until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.


In April 1640, Uvedale was again elected MP for Petersfield in the Short Parliament and was re-elected MP for Petersfield for the Long Parliament in November 1640.  He supported the Royalist cause and sat in the King's Oxford parliament. He was disabled from sitting in the Westminster before 1645. His property became much reduced in his lifetime, possibly because of his support of  the royal cause.


Uvedale died at the age of about 70 and was buried on 3 December 1652.


Uvedale married firstly, around the year 1607, Anne Carey (d. 1627), a daughter of Sir Edmund Carey of Culham and his wife Mary Crocker. She had been a maid of honour to Anne of Denmark and walked in the queen's funeral procession in 1619, listed as ""Lady Udall"".


In 1640 he married secondly Victoria Cary, daughter of Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland. Their children included:

He represented Lagos in the Legislative Council.


Olorun-Nimbe was born in Lagos to the family of Abdur-Raham and Ramotu Olorunimbe. His father was a member of Herbert Macaulay's Nigerian National Democratic Party and a Lagos-based community group known as the Egbe Ilu. Olorun-Nimbe started his education learning Quranic verses, he then proceeded to study at a government primary school in Lagos. Thereafter, he attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos before transferring to King's College, Lagos. In 1930, he gained admission into Glasgow University to study medicine. He finished his medical studies in 1938 as a qualified medical practitioner and surgeon. He returned to Nigeria in September 1938 and joined the colonial service as a Junior Medical Officer. His appointment was terminated by the colonial service in 1940 and he went into full-time private practice in Lagos establishing Alafia Hospital.


Olorun-Nimbe's foray into politics started in 1944 when he was elected a councillor in the Lagos Town Council and he was a participant in NCNC's Pan-Nigerian tour. He also contested a December 1945 by-election for the Legislative Council, and was elected with 68% of the vote, and was re-elected in the 1947 general elections. During the same year, he was also a member of NCNC's delegation to London to protest the Richards Constitution which operated on the practice of nomination rather than election to the regional and central assembly.


In 1950, the Lagos Local Government Ordinance, N.17 provided for the election of 24 councillors to the Lagos Town Council and for the position of a mayor of Lagos to be selected from those councillors. Olorun-Nimbe was selected the first mayor of Lagos in 1950 and head of Lagos Township council, he was assisted by Mbonu Ojike. He was in the position until 1953. His position as mayor caused a rift between him and the Oba of Lagos, Adeniji Adele. On 31 June 1951, under the Macpherson Constitution, Lagos colony was merged with Western Region for administrative purposes. The law allowed five representatives to represent Lagos in the regional assembly at Ibadan and also two presentatives to be chosen by the regional assembly among the elected representatives of Lagos  to represent the colony in the Federal House of Representatives. Olorun-Nimbe's party NCNC won all five Lagos seats and the party decided to send Adeleke Adedoyin and Azikiwe to the central legislature from the Western Assembly.  In the Western Assembly, the Action Group which had control of the assembly voted for Adedoyin and Olorun-nimbe as Lagos representatives to the Federal House of Representatives scuttling Azikiwe's plan to move to the center. However, contrary to NCNC's position that Olorun-Nimbe remain in Lagos as Mayor, he decided to combine both roles as mayor and Federal House of Representative refusing to step down for Azikiwe, this left the party leader out of playing any role in the center.

They were used from 1955 to 1994 to carry a 220 kilovolt (150 kilovolt until 1971) power line across the Strait of Messina, between the Scilla substation in Calabria on the Italian mainland at .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}38Â°14â²42â³N 15Â°40â²59â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.24500Â°N 15.68306Â°Eï»¿ / 38.24500; 15.68306ï»¿ (Scilla substation) and the Messina-Santo substation in Sicily at 38Â°15â²57â³N 15Â°39â²04â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.26583Â°N 15.65111Â°Eï»¿ / 38.26583; 15.65111ï»¿ (Messina-Santo substation).


The two pylons, built in 1955, are both 232-metre-high (761Â ft) free-standing steel towers. Each stands on an 8-metre-high (26Â ft) cross-shaped base and is equipped with a crossbar that carries four conductors at a height of 212 metres (696Â ft), and another V-shaped structure at the top which carries two additional conductors in addition to ground wires.  In contrast to more conventional pylon design, the corners of the pylons are arranged diagonally along the direction of the course of the line. The pylons of Messina were the model for the Elbe Crossing 1 in Germany and were, until the completion of Elbe Crossing 2, the tallest pylons in the world. They did however have the longest span of any hydroelectric crossing ever built at 3646 meters, even greater than that of the current record holder the Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie at 2,700 meters. The span was able to be so large because there wasn't a need for a high clearance, the conductors weren't as heavy and because the east tower was built on elevated ground approximately 163Â m (536Â ft) asl, giving the tower a total elevation of 396 m (1,300Â ft) above sea level.


After their completion, the oscillation of the structures and their maximum deflections were determined in a very unusual manner: engineers mounted three rockets with a thrust of 9800 kilonewtons on top of the pylons and ignited them.


The line had switching stations at each end of the span. At the Calabrian station, Cannitello, (38Â°14â²29.16â³N 15Â°41â²20.27â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.2414333Â°N 15.6889639Â°Eï»¿ / 38.2414333; 15.6889639ï»¿ (Cannitello Switching Station)), the conductors were fixed tightly to a strainer portal. At the Sicilian station at Torre Faro (38Â°16â²8â³N 15Â°38â²45â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.26889Â°N 15.64583Â°Eï»¿ / 38.26889; 15.64583ï»¿ (Torre Faro Switching Station)), the conductors were strained by a device providing constant force, which was situated in a building with two inspiring towers.


Until 1971, the electrical service consisted of a single 150Â kV three-phase AC system. Four conductors, of which one was used as backup, were installed on the crossbar of the pylon. In 1971 the voltage was increased to 220Â kV and two additional conductors were installed at the bottom site of the V-shaped pinnacles. This gave a total transmission capacity of 300Â MW.


Conductors consisting of steel and aluminium with a diameter of 27.8Â mm were used. They had an aluminium cross section of 45Â mm2 and a steel cross section of 305Â mm2. The minimum height of the conductors over the Strait of Messina was 70 metres, to allow large ships to pass safely below. This, together with the span of 3.646 kilometres (2.266Â mi), required a tension force of 608Â N/mm2 in the conductor cables. Antivibration ropes were used to dampen oscillations.


By the early 1980s, this transmission capacity was no longer sufficient. It could not be increased by using bundle conductors or more conductive cables, as bundle conductors tend to have much greater wind-induced oscillations than single conductors, which can result in short circuits in such a long span.  Normal overhead lines use conducting cables with a larger aluminium portion but these do not have the tensile strength needed for this span.  In 1985 a 380Â kV three-phase AC submarine cable with a maximum transmission capacity of 1000Â MW was laid underneath the Strait of Messina.


The electrical crossing was decommissioned in 1993 and the conductors were removed a year later.


After the removal of the power lines, the pylons remain with protected status as historical monuments and are used for meteorological measurements, high distance rescue training and telecommunications. In 2006, the staircase to the top of the Sicilian pylon was briefly opened to the public, but public access to the structure is now prohibited. The stairway to the top has approximately 1,250 steps.[unreliable source?][betterÂ sourceÂ needed]


The switching stations at both ends of the span still exist. The former anchor portal at Cannitello Switching Station is still in place but the tensioning system at Torre Faro has been dismantled. The unused power line from Scilla substation to Cannitello remains, while the line from Torre Faro Switching Station to Messina-Santo substation may be[vague] completely dismantled.


The submarine cable across the Strait of Messina was laid in 1985. It has a total transmission capacity of 1000Â MW and is a part of the single-circuit 380Â kV powerline between Rizziconi substation on the Calabrian mainland (38Â°26â²32â³N 15Â°59â²8â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.44222Â°N 15.98556Â°Eï»¿ / 38.44222; 15.98556ï»¿ (Rizziconi substation)) and Sorgente substation on Sicily (38Â°11â²17â³N 15Â°17â²1â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.18806Â°N 15.28361Â°Eï»¿ / 38.18806; 15.28361ï»¿ (Sorgente substation)). It starts at the end of the overhead line south of Villa San Giovanni (38Â°12â²11.8â³N 15Â°38â²16.47â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.203278Â°N 15.6379083Â°Eï»¿ / 38.203278; 15.6379083ï»¿ (Villa San Giovanni Cable Terminal)), enters the sea at 38Â°12â²13.4â³N 15Â°38â²0.91â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.203722Â°N 15.6335861Â°Eï»¿ / 38.203722; 15.6335861ï»¿ (Cable enters Sea), reaches Sicily in Messina (38Â°12â²57.76â³N 15Â°34â²1.79â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.2160444Â°N 15.5671639Â°Eï»¿ / 38.2160444; 15.5671639ï»¿ (Cable leaves Sea)) and ends north of Messina (38Â°13â²43.11â³N 15Â°33â²40.2â³Eï»¿ / ï»¿38.2286417Â°N 15.561167Â°Eï»¿ / 38.2286417; 15.561167ï»¿ (Messina Cable Terminal)), where the overhead line to Sorgente starts.


The cable consists of 4 conductors, one of which serves as a reserve.


Plans were announced in July 2010 to build a second 380Â kV power line between Sorgente and Rizziconi in 2015. The line will have a transmission capacity of 2000Â MW and will be 105 kilometres (65Â mi) long, with an undersea portion of 38 kilometres (24Â mi).


In May 2016 a double-circuit 380Â kV HVAC (high voltage alternating current) land and submarine cable system was handed over to the utility company.  It was installed along a total route of approximately 44Â km between the power stations of Villafranca Tirrena in Sicily and Scilla in Calabria.

49423120,Battle of GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gu%C3%A9-%C3%A0-Tresmes,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes&action=info,"The Battle of GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes (28 Februaryâ1 March 1814) was fought between 14,500 French troops led by Marshals Auguste de Marmont and Ãdouard Mortier and 12,000 Prussians commanded by Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf and Friedrich von Katzler. On 28 February the French attacked and drove the Prussians to the north along the west bank of the Ourcq River. That evening and the next day Kleist tried to push the French back while Russian units under Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich tried to cross from the east to the west bank of the Ourcq; the Allies were unsuccessful. GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes (Tresmes Ford) is located where Route D405 crosses the ThÃ©rouanne stream about 10 kilometres (6.2Â mi) northeast of Meaux.


In late February, Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von BlÃ¼cher's Allied Army of Silesia advanced west toward Paris, pressing a badly outnumbered French force before it. When Kleist's Prussian II Corps took a menacing position on the north bank of the Marne River near Meaux, the French attacked and pushed their adversaries back. When he learned that Napoleon's army was fast approaching from the southeast, BlÃ¼cher abandoned the effort to force a way past Marmont and Mortier and began retreating to the north. The action occurred during the Campaign in north-east France, part of the War of the Sixth Coalition.


On 18 February 1814, Napoleon mauled a Coalition corps led by Crown Prince Fredrick William of WÃ¼rttemberg in the Battle of Montereau. After this defeat the Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg ordered the Army of Bohemia to withdraw to Troyes. Schwarzenberg requested that his ally Gebhard Leberecht von BlÃ¼cher help defend his northern flank at MÃ©ry-sur-Seine; the Prussian general immediately marched to his aid. The Austrian intended to offer battle on 21â22 February near Troyes. However, bad news from his commander in the south, Prince Frederick VI of Hesse-Homburg altered his plans. With Marshal Pierre Augereau threatening to retake Chalon-sur-SaÃ´ne and Jean Gabriel Marchand marching on Geneva, Schwarzenberg detached Vincenzo Federico Bianchi and the Austrian I Corps plus other troops. Bianchi was ordered to march to Dijon and reinforce Hesse-Homburg's forces.


At Troyes, Schwarzenberg had 90,000 troops and BlÃ¼cher had 50,000 soldiers to pit against 75,000 men under Napoleon. Schwarzenberg's intelligence services habitually overrated French strength so he remained unaware of his nearly two-to-one superiority. The Allied soldiers had worn-out uniforms and not enough food in a region that had been stripped of supplies by both sides. On 22 February the French launched probing attacks on the Allied positions from MÃ©ry to Troyes. That day, Marshal Nicolas Oudinot's infantry cleared MÃ©ry of enemy troops and gained a foothold on the far bank, but they proved unable to hold their bridgehead against Coalition counterattacks. In this action, 3,600 French troops from Pierre FranÃ§ois Xavier Boyer's division fought against 5,000 Russians from Alexei Grigorievich Scherbatov's VI Infantry Corps of Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken's command and 1,200 men from Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's Prussian I Corps. That evening Schwarzenberg ordered his army to withdraw behind the Seine River, except for Ignaz Gyulai's III Corps, which was directed to move southeast to Bar-sur-Seine.


Disappointed that his Austrian colleague was determined to retreat, BlÃ¼cher requested permission to operate independently and it was granted him. He hoped to join forces with two corps under Ferdinand von Wintzingerode and Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von BÃ¼low and advance toward Paris by a northerly route. Meanwhile, on 23 February Schwarzenberg's army withdrew to the east. The Coalition leaders sent an envoy to Napoleon to propose a truce, but the emperor's unreasonable conditions nixed the plan.


With 53,000 troops, BlÃ¼cher's Army of Silesia began moving north on the morning of 24 February, destroying the bridges at Arcis-sur-Aube and Plancy-l'Abbaye behind it. That evening he received an order from Schwarzenberg to withdraw east and form the right flank of the Army of Bohemia. Since this would have exposed his march to a French attack, BlÃ¼cher ignored his instructions and continued marching northwest toward SÃ©zanne. Marshal Auguste de Marmont was at SÃ©zanne with 6,000 soldiers on the evening of 24 February. Detecting the build up of Allied forces in his direction, the French marshal withdrew to the Vindey heights to the west of SÃ©zanne. On 26 February Marmont fell back west toward La FertÃ©-Gaucher, while calling for Marshal Ãdouard Mortier to join him at La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre. Between Marmont and Mortier there were only 10,000 soldiers.


On 27 February the two French marshals burned the bridge at La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre before crossing the Marne River at Triport. Once on the west bank, Mortier turned north toward Varreddes while Marmont moved east toward Meaux. Forming the rearguard, Ãtienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's 8th Infantry Division and Jean-Pierre Doumerc's cavalry repulsed Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's pursuing troops and burned the bridge at Trilport.  As Marmont's troops approached Meaux, they found Russians in possession. Sacken's Russian cavalry appeared at the first bridge at Meaux and routed the 1,600 French National Guards that defended the span. The Russians quickly fanned out into the city streets while a 4-gun battery began shelling the market place. Marmont quickly gathered up the nearest available body of French soldiers and led them in an attack that drove the Russians back to the bridge. French artillery rapidly moved through the city streets and silenced the Russian battery. The French sustained 100 casualties in the skirmish. Marmont finally gained control of the Meaux bridge and demolished it.


Earlier, Mortier detached a force of 300 cavalry and 500 infantry led by Henri Baltazard Vincent. Finding himself isolated at ChÃ¢teau-Thierry, Vincent slipped out of the city on the night of 26 February. With Allied forces at large in the area, Vincent's soldiers abandoned the main roads and moved across country to reach Lizy-sur-Ourcq. In doing so, Vincent avoided Friedrich von Katzler's Prussian advanced guard which counted three cavalry regiments, three fusilier (light infantry) and two grenadier battalions, two jÃ¤ger companies and a half-battery of artillery. During the day Katzler reached the Marne at La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre and established a bridge at Sammeron. After crossing the river, Katzler found Vincent's force at Lizy-sur-Ourcq and drove it out of the village. Behind him, Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf's Prussian II Corps crossed to the north bank of the Marne.


Marmont and Mortier informed Joseph Bonaparte at Paris of their predicament; they were badly outnumbered and the capital was threatened. Raking up every available soldier from the Paris depots, Joseph immediately sent 1,300 foot soldiers and 100 lancers to the two marshals. Soon afterward, the 3,600-man 3rd Provisional Guard Infantry Division under Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan was organized and sent, together with 800 cavalry and 48 artillery pieces. After BlÃ¼cher's army left his front, Napoleon was not sure of its intentions or direction. The French emperor left Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's corps at MÃ©ry-sur-Seine and Marshal Michel Ney's corps at Arcis-sur-Aube to watch to the north. On 26 February Napoleon reinforced Ney with Nicolas-FranÃ§ois Roussel d'Hurbal's cavalry division and Pierre Boyer's infantry brigade. Even so, Napoleon did not believe BlÃ¼cher was driving toward Paris.
On the morning of 27 February, Napoleon finally received conclusive reports that BlÃ¼cher's army was advancing on Paris and had gained a 3-day head start. The French emperor ordered Marshal Jacques MacDonald to take command of the 42,000 troops opposing Schwarzenberg along the Aube River. MacDonald would have the II, VII and XI Corps and the II Cavalry, V Cavalry and VI Cavalry Corps. Napoleon took 35,000 troops and began marching northwest toward SÃ©zanne and La FertÃ©-Gaucher in BlÃ¼cher's wake. At nightfall on 27 February, Victor, the Imperial Guard and Napoleon were in SÃ©zanne while Ney's infantry, the Imperial Guard cavalry and Roussel's cavalry were in Esternay, west of SÃ©zanne. The cavalry of Ãtienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle and the infantry of Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova were coming up on Ney's left flank.


Kleist's Prussians rebuilt the bridge over the Ourcq River at Lizy and crossed to the west bank. They swung left and moved southwest to the ThÃ©rouanne stream. Since Sacken had pulled back from Meaux, Marmont and Mortier deduced that Blucher intended to envelop their left flank near Lizy. Therefore, on 28 February the two marshals moved northeast toward Lizy where they knew Kleist spent the previous night. Leading Mortier's advanced guard, Vincent bumped into Kleist's forward positions at GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes at 4:00 pm. Farther west near ÃtrÃ©pilly, Vincent cavalry charged and threw back Katzeler's outpost line. The 2nd Old Guard Division under Charles-Joseph Christiani appeared in front of GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes and took the Prussian positions under fire with 24 artillery pieces. Katzeler had the Haase Combined Fusilier Battalion, the Fusilier Battalion of the 2nd West Prussian Regiment and the HÃ¼llesheim Combined Musketeer Battalion in line to oppose the French. Kleist sent the Brandenburg Uhlans to guard Katzeler's left flank while ordering Colonel BlÃ¼cher's cavalry brigade to support the right flank.


An artillery duel between French and Prussian cannons followed, during which Kleist formed his 9th and 10th Brigades on both sides of the main highway. Christiani sent his 1st Brigade to attack GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes in front while the Fusilier-Chasseur Regiment hit the village on the right side. The assault was successful in forcing the Linsingen Combined Battalion, the 2nd Silesian Combined Battalion and two more battalions to withdraw from GuÃ©-Ã -Tresmes. As Kleist's corps withdrew to the northeast, the Prussians dismantled the bridge at Lizy. Mortier's corps swung to the right to face Lizy while Marmont's corps aggressively plunged after Kleist's men. The Prussian 9th Brigade made a stand at Le Plessis-Placy and a charge by one squadron of the Silesian Uhlans managed to stop two pursuing French battalions.


By midnight Kleist's corps was pushed behind the Gergogne stream. Back at Lizy, Mortier repulsed an assault by two regiments from Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich's Russian corps. Kleist believed that he faced Napoleon because the French soldiers yelled ""Vive l'Empereur"" (Long live the emperor). The French pursuit ended at 1:00 am on 1 March at May-en-Multien. By this hour the Prussian 9th Brigade was at Neufchelles and 10th Brigade farther north at Mareuil-sur-Ourcq. The Prussians lost 11 officers and 934 rank and file in the battle. A long artillery bombardment lasted until the next morning, punctuated by bursts of musketry. In this phase of the battle, Russian casualties numbered 400 men, the Prussians lost 150â200 and the French 80 soldiers. Historian Digby Smith estimated French losses as 250 and Prussian losses as 1,035 killed, wounded and missing.


BlÃ¼cher received a report from Cossack commander Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn that Napoleon was approaching. Recalling his drubbing in the Six Days' Campaign at the beginning of February, the Prussian field marshal immediately began transferring his army to the north bank of the Marne. By 2:00 pm on 1 March, the guns of Napoleon's advanced guard were throwing shells across the river, but it was too late to catch the Allies. By 10:00 am that morning, BlÃ¼cher's rear guard cavalry under Fyodor Karlovich Korf safely crossed to the north bank of the Marne. BlÃ¼cher had hoped to fight Napoleon with the bulk of his army, while Kleist dealt with Marmont and Mortier. Since Kleist fumbled, the Prussian army commander ordered Kleist into action again while committing major units to attack Marmont and Mortier. Yorck's I Prussian Corps marched to Crouy-sur-Ourcq while Kaptzevich and Korf moved to Gesvres farther south. Sacken at Lizy-sur-Ourcq would cover the shift while the Army of Silesia's wagon and pontoon trains were ordered northeast to Gandelu, in case a retreat to Oulchy-le-ChÃ¢teau became necessary.


While Napoleon was stalled by having to cross the Marne, BlÃ¼cher planned to launch Yorck and Kaptzevich across the Ourcq at Crouy. Yorck found the Crouy bridge destroyed so he marched north to cross at Fulaines. Sacken was drawn into a noisy skirmish at Lizy and unable to lend support. Finding that his plans were not being carried out, at 6:00 pm BlÃ¼cher ordered Kaptzevich to force a crossing at Gesvres. Despite being opposed by Doumerc's cavalry, the Russian corps commander pushed his leading elements onto the west bank. Marmont swiftly brought up his infantry and, after a stiff fight, overran Kaptzevich's small bridgehead, capturing 280â300 Russians. Kleist's attack also failed, leaving both sides in the same position as before. That night Poret de Morvan's division marched into the French camp accompanied by the rumble of 48 guns and loud cheers. Despite their great numerical advantage, the morale of the Allied soldiers sank.


On 2 March, BlÃ¼cher began retreating north in the direction of Soissons. While Yorck withdrew through ChÃ¢teau-Thierry, Kaptzevich pulled back to La FertÃ©-Milon and Sacken fell back to Ancienville. Bringing up the rear was Kleist, who was directed to send a probe south toward May-en-Multien. Led by Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten, the Silesian Hussars, Neumark Dragoons, Silesian Uhlans and two horse artillery batteries set out, supported by five battalions from the 9th Brigade. As the Prussian reconnaissance force emerged from Neufchelles, Christophe Antoine Merlin's 1st Light Cavalry Division charged them. Merlin was driven back but Ricard's 8th Division and Joseph Lagrange's 3rd Division soon appeared with 12 heavy caliber cannons. In the artillery duel that followed, six Prussian guns were knocked out of action and Zieten decided to retreat at 5:00 pm. Kleist fell back to Mareuil-sur-Ourcq but was unable to cross the river because the other corps had not passed. Not realizing the situation, Marmont did not press the Allies hard. Instead he simply bombarded Mareuil and Kleist got away.


Napoleon had no pontoon train, which slowed him down considerably. His army finally bridged the Marne at 2:00 am on 3 March, moving Louis Friant's 1st Old Guard Division, the Imperial Guard cavalry, Emmanuel de Grouchy's line cavalry and Ney's corps to the north bank. Napoleon directed Victor and Arrighi to march to ChÃ¢teau-Thierry. On 3 March, Marmont and Mortier crossed the Ourcq at La FertÃ©-Milon. Napoleon's plan was to drive the Allies back towards Oulchy-le-ChÃ¢teau. That day there was a skirmish at Neuilly-Saint-Front in which the French failed to trap the retreating Allies. Nevertheless, the French inflicted 500â600 casualties on Blucher's army. During the day Blucher attempted to get in touch with BÃ¼low and Wintzingerode who he hoped to join. He finally decided to withdraw behind the Aisne River. The next major engagement would be the Battle of Craonne on 7 March 1814.",0,14 February 2016, 6 July 2021,72,0,0

His book collection is now the NikulÃ¡s Ottenson Collection of Icelandic Books and Manuscripts, Special Collections, Milton S. Eisenhower Library, The Johns Hopkins University.


NikulÃ¡s's father was Ãssur Ãssursson (SigurÃ°sson) (1807-1874), a well-educated hreppstjÃ³ri and poet (who composed RÃ­mur af SÃ¶rla hinum sterka), who was conversant with German as well as the Scandinavian languages. NikulÃ¡s's mother was Ãssur's second wife, GuÃ°rÃºn SnÃ¦bjarnardÃ³ttir, from Dufansdalur in ArnarfjÃ¶rÃ°ur. Her nephew HÃ¡kon HÃ¡konarson was for a long time the member of parliament for BarÃ°astrÃ¶nd.


NikulÃ¡s learned to write from his father around the age of eight, and is the scribe of manuscript 28 in the NikulÃ¡s Ottensen Collection, a copy of MagnÃºs Ã­ MagnÃºsskÃ³gum's RÃ­mur af Gretti Ãsmundssyni which he made in 1915-16. As a young man, he worked inter alia in the fishing industry on the ship of his mother's brother MarkÃºs SnÃ¦bjarnarson.


In 1887, NikulÃ¡s emigrated to Canada, where he worked in military service and in a shop. He lived for a time in NÃ½ja Ãsland, but considered his career to begin in earnest when he began working for the W. E. L. (an electric train company in Winnipeg). He became the park warden at River Park, Winnipeg's foremost pleasure-garden. In 1902, NikulÃ¡s established a zoo, the first in Canada west of Toronto. After 28 years in that role, NikulÃ¡s retired.


In Winnipeg, NikulÃ¡s continued his father's scholarship, very much in a traditional nineteenth-century Icelandic mode, collecting manuscripts and publishing two books of rÃ­mur. He revisited Iceland in 1909-10.


NikulÃ¡s married Anna GuÃ°mundsdÃ³ttir of Ferjukot, and they had three children: Thordis Louise Ottenson Gudmunds (born Winnipeg 16 September 1896, known in Icelandic as LovÃ­sa), Louis, and Eddy.


NikulÃ¡s probably began collecting books as a youth, certainly bringing a copy of the Bible from his father's collection to Canada; he probably built up most of his collection in the first decade of the twentieth century, however (not least while visiting Iceland in 1909-10). In the summer of 1942, NikulÃ¡s wrote to StefÃ¡n Einarsson at Johns Hopkins University asking if StefÃ¡n could sell his collection and, with the encouragement of Kemp Malone and Isaiah Bowman, the collection was purchased from NikulÃ¡s in the winter of 1942-43 by the Johns Hopkins University Library.


The book collection prominently includes Iceland's oldest printed Bibles (the GuÃ°brandsbiblÃ­a (1584) and the ÃorlÃ¡ksbiblÃ­a in its second printing of 1644); the NÃ½ja testamenti published in WaisenhÃºs in 1746; a range of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century religious literature; and nineteenth-century journals. It also includes 28 Icelandic manuscripts, mostly from the nineteenth century, containing in particular rÃ­mur and chivalric sagas. The manuscripts are now catalogued as Ms. 100, Special Collections, Milton S. Eisenhower Library, The Johns Hopkins University).


One KristjÃ¡n Benediktsson composed the following verses in praise of NikulÃ¡s:


ÃÃ©r eru mÃ¡lin mennta kunn,
af MÃ­mis drukkin horni,
njÃ¶rvaÃ°ur frÃ¦Ã°i nÃ¡ms Ãºr brunn,
NikulÃ¡s hinn forni.

skreytir minning Ã¾Ã­na.


The arts of language are familiar to you,
drunk from MÃ­mir's horn,
deep in wisdom taken from the well,
NikulÃ¡s the ancient.

The Icelandic language, reckoned glorious,
can show you honour,
writing wrapped in special decoration

NikulÃ¡s Ottensen was a well-known figure in Winnipeg's Icelandic community. Poet Guttormur J. Guttormsson's satirical ""Winnipeg Icelander"" (1920) contains a reference to NikulÃ¡s Ottensen (called Nick Ottins or Nickie in the poem). The language parodies that spoken by urban immigrants in Winnipeg:


The poem ends with Nick Ottins inviting Dani McMillan to dine on wild game that he claims to have personally shot in flight, although it had in fact been purchased by the poem's hapless urbanite of a narrator after failing to hunt a moose.",1,15 November 2017, 9 April 2021,19,0,0
911827,Sound system (DJ),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_system_(DJ),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sound_system_(DJ)&action=info,"A sound system is a group of DJs and audio engineers contributing and working together as one, playing and producing music over a large PA system or sound reinforcement system, typically for a dance event or party.


The sound system concept originated in the 1950s in Kingston, Jamaica. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers to set up street parties. The sound system scene is a part of Jamaican cultural history and responsible for the rise of modern Jamaican musical styles such as ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub. When Jamaicans emigrated to the United Kingdom, the sound system culture followed and became firmly rooted there in the 1970s. It is still strongly linked with those Jamaican-originated music genres, and some bands or producers still call themselves sound systems, such as Dub Narcotic Sound System and the On-U Sound System. When Asian Dub Foundation are advertised as Asian Dub Foundation, the whole band performs, but when they announce themselves as Asian Dub Foundation Sound System, members of the band mix and play music (by other artists, as well as their own) while one or two MCs rap over the songs. The term also has become connected with sound reinforcement systems by DJs.


The term ""sound system"" is also used to refer to a free party sound system, also known as a rig. The equipment includes a van, loudspeakers, amplifiers, turntable decks and cables. Larger rigs might also have a fog machine, stage lighting, video projectors and an electrical generator; the generator enables the sound system to be set up anywhere. A sound system collective is usually five or more people, with larger sound systems having more members.  Equipment is owned by some and others are DJs, record producers or enthusiastic ravers who help out. They will be the people who organise free parties and teknivals and will be a group of friends with similar interests. Some owners purposely use second hand equipment, to reduce their risk if the equipment is stolen or damaged. This type of rig is called a ""suicide rig"" and usually used at insecure locations where it may get stolen or damaged and if it is suspected that police will have knowledge of the party.


Sometimes a sound system collective is well known for its wide travels. This type of collective can be described as modern Nomad tribes or New age travellers. In this context the word sound system is used interchangeably to describe either the group of people or the equipment. The techno travelling scene of the 1990s was made of sound system crews like Bedlam sound system and Spiral Tribe. The free party community has been criticized for the unkempt appearance of attendees to such events, accusations of substance abuse of illegal drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, amphetamines and LSD, and complaints about messes left behind by such parties have given the scene a negative reputation. However, despite such complaints, the scene continues to grow with a large following in Bristol, Abergavenny, Newport, London, Devon and Cornwall.",3,19 August 2004, 19 June 2021,165,0,0

61784354,William Henry Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Henry_Black&action=info,"William Henry Black FSA (7 May 1808 â 12 April 1872) was a Victorian antiquarian and Seventh-Day Baptist leader. During his lifetime, he was well known in London antiquarian and literary circles for his talent for paleography and archiving. He was the member of many historical societies, and the founder of three more. He published numerous articles and books, during his lifetime, with more published posthumously.


Black was lesser known, but equally regarded, for his prominence in London Seventh-Day Baptist circles, leading a small congregation in London, which never held more than twenty people. This circle was the subject of a newspaper article in 1869, where the reporter wrote of the contrast between the dilapidated building the services were held in, and their leader, Black, who appeared as ""a profound scholar and most courteous gentleman"".


William Henry Black was born on 7 May 1808, in Walworth, Surrey, to Mary and John Black of Kitmore. His mother's family, the Langleys, were the wealthy proprietors of estates in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and strongly influenced Black's religious and historical interests, as well as his future religious opinion. He was educated at a private school, and acted as the tutor of several families in Tulse Hill when he was seventeen.


The earliest record of Black's antiquarian interests exist in his catalogues of various libraries. He catalogued the Arundel Manuscripts, at the College of Arms in 1829 (before they were purchased by the British Library) and, as the Leathersellers' Company requested in 1831, Abraham Colfe's grammar school library. From 1831 to 1833, Black worked in Oxford, compiling a catalogue of Elias Ashmole's manuscripts, published in 1845, to much esteem. Early on in his career, he was also a contributor to the works of other antiquarians, including Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet's The History of Modern Wiltshire (11 vols; 1822â44) and Samuel Bentley's Excerpta Historica (1831). Upon the 1834 Burning of Parliament, Black boasted that he had been the earliest researcher to rush into the parliament buildings in hope of saving their valuable records. Thanks to the many literary contacts he had made while a reader at the British Museum, Black obtained a position at the Record Commission, a 19th-century royal commission into the state of the nation's archives.


This position at the commission proved valuable to Black, as his antiquarian interests were occupied with the training of junior transcribers, and revision of Thomas Rymer's Foedera, a set of volumes detailing ""all the leagues, treaties, alliances, capitulations, and confederacies, which have at any time been made between the Crown of England and any other kingdoms, princes and states"". He also produced an original work in this time, Docquets of Letters Patent Passed Under Charles I, 1642-6, which was printed in 1837, but only published posthumously.


In 1840, again thanks to his literary connections, and his reputation as a paleographer, Black acquired the position of assistant keeper at the Public Record Office, which had been established only two years earlier. His duties, here, included cataloguing the Pell Office records and preparing reports on the records of HM Treasury. This career lasted until 1853, as his vehement Sabbatarianism annoyed his employers, who required him to work on Saturdays, though his duties at the Treasury continued until 1854.


Black was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1858, and was appointed into the Society's council three times, in 1863, 1864, and 1867. He was one of the earliest members of the British Archaeological Association (est. 1843) the Camden Society, and several English local history societies, specifically: the Surrey, London and Middlesex, and Wiltshire Archaeological societies. He was also the founder of three antiquarian societies, all concerning Biblical archaeology: the Chronological Institute of London (est. 1850), the Palestine Archaeological Association, and the Anglo-Biblical Institute. By 1870, each of these had been voluntarily subsumed into the newly founded Society of Biblical Archaeology (which was, itself, later absorbed into the Royal Asiatic Society). According to Bernard Nurse of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Black was ""highly regarded by his contemporaries"", and John Ashton, writing for the Dictionary of National Biography, has called him ""a conscientious and painstaking antiquary"". In his obituary, he was flatteringly described as being ""richly stored with archaic learning and palaeographical knowledge, which he was always alike ready to impart to the youthful student and to give to the world at large.""


Black was a prolific historical researcher. He issued several pamphlets on Biblical history, and the majority of issues of the Journal of the British Archaeological Association, from 1846 to 1872, contained articles by him. As a fellow of the society, several of his communications were published in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London, between 1861 and 1871. His first communication to the Society concerned the will of Hans Holbein the Younger, and caused a significant stir, with his obituary in the Proceedings claiming it caused ""a complete revolution in the history of Holbein's works"". Black also edited three volumes of early modern English poetry, for publication by the Percy Society. Near the end of his life, Black prepared an edition of the Antonine Itinerary for the Rolls Series, which Ashton recorded ""still await[ed] editing and publication"" in 1886, and never ended up being published.


In 1840, Black became the afternoon preacher of a small Seventh-Day Baptist community in Mill Yard, on Leman Street, Whitechapel, following from J. B. Shepston. During this time there were only five members: himself, and the Slaters: Harriet (his third wife), Ann, Charlotte and Sophia. Here, he occupied the minister's house of 15 Mill Yard. While he served here, the congregation never grew over twenty people. At this congregation, Black was constantly involved in litigation relating to his religious matters. A member of the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral charged Black with crypto-Judaism, due to his emphasis in the Old Testament in his sermons, a charge which Black vigorously rebuked. In 1851, he was charged with libeling a fellow Baptist minister, and was forced to pay heavy damages. Black continued as the minister of this congregation until his death, in 1872. He was followed by his son-in-law, William Mead Jones. In 1885, this congregation moved from Mill Yard, as their premises were sold on to the LTS Railway Company.


In 1869, Black's congregation was the subject of a newspaper article by C. M. Davies, where he found the building in disrepair, with a languishing fourteen-person congregation, in an ""unlikely-looking, unsavoury place"". Despite this, Davies records his meeting with Black as a pleasant surprise:


A venerable scholar-like old man, arrayed in clerical black, and with a long white beard, received me most courteously, [...] I expected to find some illiterate minister, with a hobby ridden to death, when loÂ ! I found myself in the presence of a profound scholar and most courteous gentleman, who informed me that he thought in Latin, said his prayers in Hebrew, and read his New Testament lessons from the original Greek. [...] Shall I add another ""idea"" also? â that it would be no harm if some of our Sunday preachers would take a quiet run out on Saturday to Goodman's Fields, and carry away an original notion or two from [...] the Seventh-day Baptist minister, William Henry Black, FSA.

William Henry Black was married three times. Black first married, at age twenty-two, to Elizabeth White. They had three daughters. In 1841, Black was remarried to Mary Anne (d. 1843), daughter of doctor Benjamin Noakes. Again, in 1844, Black was remarried to Harriot (d. 1861), daughter of William Slater, minister of Mill Yard.  Theodora, Black's daughter, married William Mead Jones, who became his successor as pastor.


While at his job in the Public Record Office, Black suffered a marked decline in health, and believed his vision was damaged after a sewage-related incident in the Treasury Chambers. Davies recorded that Black was a keen poet, ""one of the irritabile genus vatum [irritable race of poets (Horace)]"", having rebuked claims of crypto-Judaism using the medium. Black died in Mill Yard, on 12 April 1872, leaving behind less than Â£1500 in his will.",1,15 September 2019, 1 October 2020,21,0,0

Price lived in Chicago as a child and attended John Marshall High School.  Price moved to Los Angeles and sang in various groups before being asked to replace Edwards after Temptations leader Otis Williams fired Edwards. Price joined the group just as they were leaving their longtime label Motown for Atlantic Records. Price was the principal lead vocalist on ""Hear to Tempt You"" and one of the featured lead vocalists on ""Bare Back"".


He then joined The Drifters and remained with them through the first half of the 1980s, while also doing occasional studio singing with groups like Heatwave on their album, Current.  In the late 1980s, Price signed with Motown and recorded his self-titled debut album, Louis Price, which was released in 1991.

Each athlete received three throws in the qualifying round. All who achieved the qualifying distance progressed to the final. Each finalist was allowed three throws in last round, with the top eight athletes after that point being given three further attempts.


In the qualifying round, Maria Andrejczyk threw a Polish national record 67.11m, moving her to the # 16 thrower of all time.  Of course, several women on that same list also qualified for the final, including world record holder and 2016 non-Russian world leader Barbora Å potÃ¡kovÃ¡.  Vera Rebrik had thrown 67.30 in February, but Russia was on suspension.


Flor Ruiz started the final round with a 61.54 m.  Two throws later Tatsiana Khaladovich raised the stakes to 62.68 m.  Two throws later Andrejczyk displaced Ruiz with a 61.92.  Sunette Viljoen moved on top with a 64.92 m.  Near the top of the second round, Kathryn Mitchell almost matched it with a 64.36 to move into silver position.  2015 World silver medalist LÃ¼ Huihui moved into bronze position with a 63.50 m that lasted until the end of the round when two-time defending champion Å potÃ¡kovÃ¡ moved into the bronze position with a 63.73 m.  Khaladovich came back in the third round with a 64.60 m to move into the silver spot.  After the field dropped off returning bronze medalist Linda Stahl, 21 year old Sara Kolak threw 66.18Â mÂ (217Â ftÂ 1Â in) to rocket from sixth to first.  As second thrower in the fifth round, Andrejczyk threw 64.78 m to leapfrog from seventh to bronze medal position.  That only lasted a few throwers until Å potÃ¡kovÃ¡ threw 2Â cm further.


For Kolak, whose previous medal collection included the bronze medal from the 2016 European Championships, it was a new Croatian National Record, beating the 64.30 m she set in qualifying, which beat the 63.50 she threw winning the European bronze. Prior to 2016, her best was still the national record, but was a 57.79 from 2013, improving 8.39Â mÂ (27Â ftÂ 6Â in) in just 5 months.  Kolak moved into the #20 position on the all-time list.

He lives in San Francisco, California.


Aminoff is a clinical neurologist and neurophysiologist, clinical investigator, university professor, author, and editor with a special interest in medical history. He was born and educated in England, graduating from University College London in 1962 and as a physician from University College Hospital Medical School in 1965. He subsequently trained in neurology and neurophysiology at The National Hospital (Queen Square) in London, and moved to San Francisco in 1976 where he has been Professor of Neurology since 1982 at the School of Medicine of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). He was Director of UCSF's Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratories until 2004. Aminoff currently directs UCSF's Parkinson's Disease Clinic and Research Center, a National Parkinson Foundation Center of Excellence.


Aminoff has received numerous honors and awards for his work as an educator and neurologist, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine in 2006, and the 2007 A.B. Baker Award of the American Academy of Neurology for lifetime achievements and contributions to medical education. From 2004 to 2012 he was a director of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, serving as chair of the board in 2011 and in 2010 UCSF awarded him the title of Distinguished Professor. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London as well as of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Neurological Association.


He has authored many medical and scientific papers, particularly on electrophysiological studies of the nervous system in health and disease. His scientific published works earned him a Doctorate in Science, an advanced doctorate in the Faculty of Science from the University of London, in 2000. He has written or edited 40 books, including several comprehensive textbooks that have gone into numerous editions. His published works have been translated into 8 languages. He was editor-in-chief of the neuroscience journal Muscle and Nerve from 1998 to 2007, was one of the two editors-in-chief (along with Robert B. Daroff) of the four-volume Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, and is one of three series editors of the multivolume Handbook of Clinical Neurology published by Elsevier.


Aminoff has a longstanding interest in the history of medicine and is the author of biographies of C.E. Brown-SÃ©quard and Sir Charles Bell. With Larry R. Faulkner he edited a volume on the history of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.


Aminoff received a bachelor of science degree from University College London (1962) and his medical degree (M.B., B.S.) from University College Hospital (UCH) Medical School (London) in 1965. After internship at UCH, he trained in internal medicine at various London teaching hospitals, gained membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London (equivalent to obtaining certification in internal medicine in the U.S.) and then trained in neurology and clinical neurophysiology at the Middlesex Hospital and the National Hospitals for Nervous Diseases (Queen Square and Maida Vale) in London. He received his M.D. degree, which in England is awarded for an advanced research thesis, for his experimental studies at the Institute of Neurology (London) on the spinal integration of various inputs to respiratory motor neurons. He subsequently moved to the University of California San Francisco, where he has held various faculty positions in the department of neurology, becoming a full professor in 1982, and was awarded the title of distinguished professor in 2010. He was certified in neurology by the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology (ABPN) in 1982 (recertified, 2004) and received subspecialty certification in clinical neurophysiology by the ABPN when this new subspecialty was created in 1992 (recertified 2002). In 2000 the University of London awarded him a doctorate in science (a higher doctorate in the faculty of science) for his electrophysiological studies of the nervous system in health and disease.


Aminoff is a clinical neurologist and neurophysiologist whose original contributions have been in several overlapping areas, utilizing electrophysiological techniques to investigate the functioning of the nervous system in health and disease. His work has been directed at extending the clinical applications of electrodiagnostic techniques or at providing insight into the underlying pathophysiology of various disorders. His work on different aspects of the autonomic nervous system showed involvement of sympathetic fibers in entrapment neuropathies; the importance of spinal mechanisms in the control of breathing; the nature and consequences of the dysautonomia occurring in patients with Parkinsonâs disease; and the nature of the involuntary motor activity that follows cessation of the cerebral circulation (syncope). His studies of the physiology of sensory discrimination and motor control showed that the discrimination-response system is organized as a parallel network rather than in the serial manner often portrayed, and he provided evidence that the long-latency stretch responses have a transcerebral pathway in humans, are under some degree of voluntary control, and relate to the organization of the discrimination-response system. His studies provided electrophysiological evidence for different types of dementia and defined their electrophysiological characteristics.


Aminoff's clinical studies of spinal vascular malformations (dural arteriovenous fistulas) led to a new theory on their pathophysiology. He and his collaborators suggested that increased venous pressure reduces the intramedullary arteriovenous pressure gradient and thus blood flow, leading to spinal cord ischemia. This is now widely accepted and has had major implications for the treatment of these lesions. His later interest in movement disorders led him to show the utility of botulinum toxin in the treatment of various movement disorders, and then to study gene therapy in managing patients with Parkinsonâs disease.


Aminoff has devoted many years to medical education. As a director and chair of the American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology, of the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and of the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology, he was concerned with syllabus development, setting national guidelines and educational standards, and assessing competence in clinical neurophysiology and clinical neurology. He lectures frequently at regional, national and international meetings, has authored or edited numerous books on neurological science and education, and in 2003 was appointed one of the series editors of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology. His teaching contributions have led to several national awards.

22648422,Piano and String Quartet (Feldman),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_and_String_Quartet_(Feldman),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piano_and_String_Quartet_(Feldman)&action=info,"Piano and String Quartet is a composition by American avant-garde composer Morton Feldman. It was commissioned by the Kronos Quartet and pianist Aki Takahashi, who premiered the piece at the 7th annual New Music America Festival in Los Angeles and released a studio recording in 1993.


Feldman composed Piano and String Quartet in 1985 at the age of 59. It was among his final major completed works.[note 1] He had written the composition with the Kronos Quartet and Takahashi in mind as its performers. It was commissioned for the seventh New Music America Festival in Los Angeles. He wrote out the score by hand, as he did for most of his music from the period.


On November 2, 1985, the Kronos Quartet and Takahashi premiered the piece at New Music America. The performance took place at the Leo S. Bing Theater in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, beginning at 5Â p.m. and lasting 68Â½ minutes. A recording of the premiere was broadcast at 8Â p.m. on KUSC, the region's local classical music radio station.


Feldman died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 61 less than two years after the premiere. Interest in his music grew rapidly in the short period after his death and his previously scarce discography was populated with numerous new recordings, mostly on independent labels. In a 1994 interview, Harrington said the following about the quartet's work with the composer:


Morton Feldman was unlike any other composer we've ever worked with. He wrote pieces that have a sense of time and a kind of realm that is very particular to his music. And I think Piano and String Quartet is one of his great, great pieces. It's almost like feeling these incredible, warm, slow, beautiful drops of water over a long period of time. Not like a water torture, butâfor meâa kind of sensual experience. You begin hearing the passage of time differently after listening to Morton's music.

Another great admirer of Piano and String Quartet, the minimalist composer Steve Reich, encountered the piece years after its premiere. Reich regarded Feldman as an early influence and a friend, but they had lost touch in the 1980s: ""when Feldman started writing longer pieces,"" he later wrote, ""I foolishly didn't take the time to listen to them and Feldman drifted out of my musical consciousness."" After Feldman died, Reich belatedly sought out his final works and was astonished by their sophistication. According to Reich, Piano and String Quartet ""is the most beautiful work of his that I knowÂ ... I wanted to call him, to tell him, that I had missed the boat with his late pieces, to ask how he made themâbut was no longer possible.""


Piano and String Quartet is a chamber music composition scored for piano, two violins, viola, and cello, following the standard instrumentation used in most piano quintets since the late 19th century. Feldman's piece is regarded among the most innovative piano quintets of late 20th century, alongside quintets by Rochberg and Schnittke. Although the title is a generic reference to the piece's musical form, it is considered.[clarification needed]


Feldman composed the piece during what is now considered to be his late period, spanning 1977 until his death in 1987. In his late-period compositions, Feldman's central concern turned from timbreâi.e., the textural quality of soundâto perception of time. Piano and String Quartet typifies the composer's late-period preoccupation with time and memory. The most salient qualities of Piano and String Quartet are extremes of duration and repetition. The score contains 810 bars. A typical performance takes approximately 80â90 minutes, much longer than most music written by his peers in the avant-garde or even his own early works. However, it is only moderate length by the standard of his late works. Most of his later works last one to two hours, with a handful that endure for three hours or longer. An uninterrupted performance of his longest workâString Quartet II (1983), also composed for the Kronos Quartetâtypically lasts six hours; its exceptionally long runtime influenced Feldman to write Piano and String Quartet as a much shorter piece for the quartet.[note 2]


As its title suggests, the piece sets the piano and string quartet apart as two distinct, almost detached entities. For the entirety of the piece, the musicians follow a simple pattern: the string quartet plays a sustained chord, and the pianist plays an arpeggiated or ""broken"" chord. The string instruments occasionally play the same pitch, creating a unison rather than a chord. After about 50 minutes, the string instruments sometimes play pizzicato, plucking rather than bowing. The sustain pedal of the piano remains pressed down for the entire performance, which indefinitely lengthens the notes and causes sympathetic resonance among the strings.


The harmonic content shifts throughout, but without a traditional sense of musical development. Its stillness has drawn comparisons to ambient music. But contrary to its apparent lack of direction, its structure is highly complex. According to the Rough Guide to classical music, the piece initially ""seems to have no beginning or end, no intention or direction""; however, the listener's attention is gradually enhanced and subtle changes in tone become magnified as it progresses, until even the subtlest differences take on the capacity to impart ""a resonance and an intensity that is startling."" Upon reading the score, Steve Reich found that many of its ""quiet mysterious chords"" were in fact ""inversions of themselves"", and that ""[r]epetitions of material were never exact repetitions"". A cello motif recurs throughout, albeit in transposed variations.


As of August 2020, five recordings of Feldman's Piano and String Quartet have been commercially released.


The Kronos Quartet and Takahashi recorded the piece in November 1991 at Skywalker Ranch in Nicasio, California, with production by Judith Sherman. By that time, the Kronos Quartet and Sherman had become frequent collaborators. She had produced some of the quartet's most acclaimed albums, including their 1990 studio recording of George Crumb's Black Angels. Sherman called the Skywalker facilities ""the most perfect recording room"", noting that the reverberation was distributed remarkably evenly across the frequency band.


The album was released on September 28, 1993, through Nonesuch Records, a subsidiary of Elektra that had been the quartet's record label since 1985. It was positively received by critics. John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune praised the performers' ""miraculous control, dedication and concentration"". Although he cautioned that less-adventurous listeners may find the recording to be ""the aural equivalent of Chinese water torture, made all the more excruciating by its quiet dynamics and lack of rhythmic, melodic or harmonic gesture"", he noted that ""[o]thers will find Feldman's tranquil, self-contained sounds a balm for ears and spirit long since turned off by the busy density that characterizes so much new music."" Art Lange called it ""[m]usic unlike any other"" in a review for the classical music magazine Fanfare, though he hedged that those already ""familiar with Feldman's idiom"" would likely consider the newly recorded piece ""different enough, without making any major breakthroughs"". The Wire's Andy Hamilton wrote ""I'm not sure I fully understand what it's about, but this composer is certainly a deep cat.""


Glenn Swan of AllMusic called the recording ""[b]reathtaking"" and wrote that the musicians ""conjure up the ghost of Feldman to wander the streets of New York as if they were abandoned. This single piece, over 79 minutes in length, is like an icy flower that blooms almost undetected."" Reviewing the Kronos Quartet for the 1995 Spin Alternative Record Guide, critic Alex Ross gave the record a perfect scoreâthe highest rating for the quartet's discographyâand called it ""the group's major achievement so far"". In the 2002 book Classical Music: The Listener's Companion, Raymond S. Tuttle recommended it as an ""excellent"" and comparatively accessible entry point for a listener new to Feldman's music: ""Once you surrender traditional expectations about what music is supposed to do, you're overwhelmed by its ethereal beauty"". In an article recommending the best music for each hour of the day, rock musician Elvis Costello cited it as the best record to listen to at 4Â a.m., writing ""Feldman's almost seamless fabric of musicÂ ... is both hypnotic and transporting"". When Takahashi returned to Los Angeles in 2006 for her first concert there since the 1985 premiere of Piano and String Quartet, Mark Swed said her recording with the Kronos Quartet was ""now a classic in the modern chamber repertory"".


Sherman received the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Classical at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards in March 1994. The studio version of Piano and String Quartet with Takahashi appeared on the third disc of the 1998 compilation Kronos Quartet: 25 Years, a ten-CD box set.


John Tilbury and the Smith Quartet played the piece at the 2006 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival on November 26. Selected live recordings from those performances were released in three volumes by Matchless Recordings in audio-only DVD format, which allowed for uninterrupted playback of the long recordings on a single disc. At just shy of 90 minutes, it is the longest recorded performance of the piece. The Smith Quartet played without vibrato and loosened their bows to enable longer, softer tones. Colin Clarke of the journal Tempo praised ""the utmost delicacy"" of Tilbury's playing and compared the recording favorably to the original: ""The sense of space, so evident in the Nonesuch version, is here even more entrenchedâthere is almost a feeling of risk in how long the gaps between statements of the prevailing arpeggio figure can last."" Critics named it among the 10 best ""Modern Composition"" releases of 2010 in The Wire's year-in-review Rewind issue.


The CD was released by Long Arms Records, a label co-founded by the composer Sergey Kuryokhin. Opus Posth performed the piece once more for a CD release concert at the Moscow International House of Music on January 31, 2015.",1,2 May 2009, 14 September 2021,44,2,2

He was born at Oggiono near Milan. Of the details of his life, we know almost nothing â not even the date of his important series of frescoes painted for the church of Santa Maria della Pace in Milan. He probably died in Milan. Luigi Lanzi gave 1530 as the date of his death, but various writers in Milan say it took place in 1540, and now the best accepted date is 1549.


He was a hard-working artist, but his work has since been criticized by some for paintings are wanting in vivacity of feeling and purity of drawing, while, in his composition, it has been well said that ""intensity of color does duty for intensity of sentiment."" He copied Leonardo's Last Supper repeatedly, and one of his best copies is in the possession of the Royal Academy of Arts. The Hungarian art critic Paul George Konody, in examining the Isleworth Mona Lisa, wrote of that painting:


The hands, with their careful and somewhat hard drawing and terra cotta coloring, suggest at once the name of Leonardo's pupil, Marco d' Oggionno; whereas the inimitably soft and lovely painting of the head and bust, the exquisite subtlety of the expression, the golden glow of the general coloring, can be due only to Leonardo"".

His two most notable pictures â one in the Pinacoteca di Brera (representing St. Michael), and the other in the private gallery of the Bonomi family (representing the Madonna) â are signed with his name in Latin, ""Marcus"".


His other works can be seen at Berlin, Paris, St. Petersburg and Turin, the one in Russia being a clever copy of the Last Supper by Leonardo. He cannot be regarded as an important artist, or even a very good copyist, but in his pictures the sky and mountains and the distant landscapes are always worthy of consideration, and in these we probably get the painter's best original work.",10,17 October 2006, 2 July 2021,72,0,0

It was founded in 2017 and is active only in the state of Utah. The party identifies itself as politically moderate, and was created out of frustration with the Republican and Democratic parties.


Prior to the formation of the United Utah Party, Brigham Young University (BYU) political science professor Richard Davis had considered forming a political party for years. According to Davis, he found people were open to an alternative political party during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He announced the formation of the party on May 22, 2017. Davis became a chairperson for the party. Jim Bennett, the son of former U.S. Senator Bob Bennett, was the party's executive director until he stepped down to run as the UUP's candidate in a special congressional election to replace Jason Chaffetz.
Nils Bergeson, a former U.S. foreign service officer, became the party's second executive director in 2018.


On May 26, 2017, Jim Bennett attempted to apply as an affiliated candidate in Utah's 3rd congressional district special election, 2017, but the lieutenant governor's office rejected the application because the elections office had not had 30 days to finish certifying the new party. Bennett refused to register as an unaffiliated candidate. Utah's elections office certified the party on June 27, 2017.


On June 21, 2017, the UUP filed a lawsuit against Utah state officials to get Bennett's name on the ballot. In court, a Utah state attorney argued that the UUP could have formed earlier to meet the application deadline. A party lawyer argued that only a ""soothsayer"" could have predicted that Jason Chaffetz would resign from the U.S. House of Representatives. On August 2, 2017, a federal judge in charge of the case ordered Utah election officials to allow Bennett on the ballot under the United Utah Party.


In late September 2017, Bennett narrowly qualified to participate in the Utah Debate Commission's selective debate, along with the election's Republican and Democratic candidates, John Curtis and Kathie Allen. The special election was held on November 7, 2017, and Bennett conceded the race hours after the polls closed and initial results showed Curtis winning and Allen getting second place. Bennett got third place with 9.3% of the popular vote.


In February 2018, two UUP candidates announced they would run for the United States House of Representatives: Jan Garbett and Logan, Utah native Eric Eliason, who challenged Republicans Chris Stewart and Rob Bishop respectively. On March 20, 2018, the United Utah Party held caucuses at 19 locations with attendance of just over 900 people, when the party had just over 400 registered members. Garbett later withdrew from the race. Eliason was defeated, receiving 11.6% of the vote as Rob Bishop was reelected to what would become his final term.


According to former UUP chairman Richard Davis, the party's platform is mostly based on laws and principles, rather than specific social positions. He told The Salt Lake Tribune that the party supports term limits, stricter campaign-finance laws, efforts to stop gerrymandering, and increased school funding. The party's platform also includes enforcing immigration laws ""with compassion,"" and generally opposes abortion with specific exceptions. The party believes that public lands can be preserved while still allowing economic development. The UUP supports the right of responsible gun owners to possess firearms.


The UUP supports efforts to stop using taxpayer money in the Utah Republican Party's closed primary elections. On December 1, 2017, the party called for greater transparency regarding sexual harassment allegations on Capitol Hill. In January 2018, the UUP announced support for the ""Our Schools Now"" initiative, a proposed progressive tax meant to increase funding for education.",3,26 May 2017, 30 June 2021,120,0,0

Etter,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_C._Etter,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Margaret_C._Etter&action=info,"Margaret Cairns Etter, known informally as Peggy Etter (12 September 1943 â 9 June 1992), was an American chemist who contributed to the development of solid state chemistry for crystalline organic compounds. She is known for her work characterizing and classifying contacts by hydrogen bonds in organic compounds. Her ""enlightened imagination, innovative creativity, and unfailing enthusiasm"" is recognised as having a ""transformative effect"" in many areas of organic chemistry.


Etter was born as Margaret Cairns in Greenville, a town in Delaware near Wilmington. Her father, Theodore (Ted) Cairns, was a chemist by profession at DuPont. Etter attained her B.Sc. at the University of Pennsylvania, spending a freshman semester at Cornell (where she met future collaborator Joel Bernstein in the Mugwuamp freshman orientation group), and completed a master's degree at the University of Delaware in 1971 with Harold Kwart. Her Ph.D. research was completed at the University of Minnesota as a National Science Foundation predoctoral fellow under the supervision of Jack Gougoutas. Her thesis and postdoctoral work focused on the study of the chemical and structural properties of polyvalent iodine compounds using X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. Her Ph. D work was published and still provides a model for how topotactic reactions should be studied.


After a brief stay as an assistant professor at Augsburg College, Etter obtained employment in the Central Research Laboratories at the mile-square 3M campus in Maplewood, Minnesota as a researcher. She collaborated with several research groups to study crystalline compounds and polymers, including molecular salts based on two photographic dyes that formed no fewer than 14 polymorphs.


Due to the difficulties of maintaining a stable research program at 3M, Etter returned to the University of Minnesota first as a postdoctoral researcher in solid state NMR with Robert Bryant, and later as professor (from 1984) at the School of Chemistry. For the rest of her career she devoted herself to the investigation of the properties of crystalline solids and hydrogen bonds. Her work influenced several areas of interest in the field of solid state organic chemistry, such as crystal growth, clathrate formation, phase transitions, supramolecular chemistry and co-crystals (a term she essentially defined in the community). Much of her work was truly interdisciplinary. Etter's key contribution was the use of graph sets to analyze hydrogen bond patterns (rather than the more conventional analysis of individual bonds), a path against the prevailing attitude that hydrogen bonding in organic solids was too complicated to understand. The establishing of the ""Etter Rules"" was later reported in Accounts of Chemical Research ""Encoding and Decoding Hydrogen Bond Patterns in Organic Compounds"" which since has been cited more than 4,000 times. Such representation is widely used in structural chemistry and solid state chemistry for the description of organic compounds. The use of ""Etter Rules"" was reviewed (with further results incorporated) in Angewandte Chemie, and the approach was incorporated into the CSD software for automatic analysis of structures.


In April 1991 Etter was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer, in the most productive phase of her career that she herself described as being ""on a roll"". Her final appearance was on a tour of Israel to coincide with the Israel Chemical Society Annual Meeting, when she visited the Weizmann Institute and the Technion, places she had always wanted to visit due to the concentration of organic solid-state chemists. Additionally, during this visit she gave a plenary lecture on her research. Shortly after her return to the United States, Etter was placed in hospice care due to a rapid deterioration of her health. She died on June 9, 1992.


In 1979, Etter received the ""Good Neighbor"" award from the Minnesota radio station WCCO for her contributions to the development of the school science program STEP at 3M. Her outreach work focused on improving the opportunities for women in science, lecturing on the subject to high school and college students, and serving as a role model for female undergraduate and graduate students. During her illness on Thanksgiving Day 1991, Minnesota Public Radio paid a special tribute to her.


Etter was recognized as an early pioneer in the Chemistry Department of the University of Minnesota due to the research she conducted related to ""... the applications of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the design and properties of organic non-linear optical materials, and most significantly, in the understanding and utilization of hydrogen-bonding interactions in crystals."" Her work was recognized with many international awards and fellowships through her career:


In recognition of both her scientific achievements and her work as a mentor to students and novice scientists, the American Crystallographic Association launched two awards in honor of Peggy Etter: the Margaret C. Etter Early Career Award, given to scientists who have made important contributions early in their careers, and the Margaret C. Etter Student Lecturer Award, awarded to a selection of students for their oral presentations at the annual conference of the association.


In addition, the University of Minnesota holds an annual Etter Memorial Lecture and hosts an endowed lectureship in solid state chemistry and materials science bearing her name.",3,5 September 2018, 28 April 2021,69,0,0
30203885,DotConnectAfrica,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DotConnectAfrica,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DotConnectAfrica&action=info,"DotConnectAfrica Trust (DCA) is an independent non-profit, non-partisan organisation that was founded  in 2006.  The organization was incorporated in Mauritius with the intention to sponsor, establish and operate the proposed new Top Level Domain (TLD) "".africa"". Its main charitable objects are: (a) for the advancement of education in information technology to the African society; and (b) in connection with (a) to provide the African society with a continental Internet domain name to have access to Internet services for the people of Africa as a purpose beneficial to the public in general.


DotConnectAfrica also set up an affiliate DCA Registry Services Ltd. in Nairobi, Kenya, which will be running the registry operation.  The DCA registry intends to channel surplus resources gained from the .Africa registry operation to sponsor foundations that will cater to various charitable projects including the already launched miss.africa and generation.africa, as well as capacity building for African ccTLDs, with the general objective of improving the African Internet and business landscape.


According to the organization website, the governance model is to be adapted from Africa's development policy model augmented with other geo-TLD models. Public Policy consideration will include direct input from African policy makers, including the African Union, Economic Commission for Africa and African Development Bank on policy matters.


Sophia Bekele, director of DotConnectAfrica, has undertaken policy-level work at ICANN.  She served as a gNSO Council member from 2005 to 2007 and participated in the new gTLD policy development process (PDP). Bekele initiated the .africa TLD in 2006 in ICANN and announced during the Paris ICANN International meeting to the stakeholders, her organization  will made  a bid for the .africa TLD. DCA  presented the DotAfrica (.africa) gTLD initiative to several inter-governmental bodies in Africa such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and the African Union Commission (AUC). The UNECA endorsed DotConnectAfrica's application in 2008.  The AUC also endorsed the proposal in 2009.


In readiness for the important task of applying for a geographic TLD, DCA also presented the DotAfrica (.africa) gTLD initiative to several inter-governmental bodies in Africa such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and the African Union Commission (AUC) under African Union. The UNECA is the regional economic development body of the United Nations in Africa. It helps the AU in meeting its strategic objectives in the areas of knowledge management and sharing, technical implementation capacity, studies and research; the results of which are disseminated to different African countries to help them in policy formulation, implementation of economic development goals and objectives, and capacity building.


DCA then received an endorsement for its DotAfrica (.africa) initiative from the UNECA economic grouping which has all the African countries as its member states.
DCA also presented and clarified the DotAfrica (.africa) initiative to the African Union Commission and after working closely with AU officials, received an early endorsement in support of its gTLD proposal in 2009.


DCA also received other endorsement from key organizations of global public internet such as Internationalized Domain Resolution Union (IDRU) which deals with global multi-language initiatives, whose members also contributed to ICANN IDN policy process.


After the approvals by the Pan African institutions, DotConnectAfrica then launched and run a 6-year successful ""Yes2dotAfrica"" global awareness campaign as an ongoing effort to create awareness of the benefits of a dotAfrica name and do a public outreach. This campaign initiative, also part of DCA's Trust program is meant to give Africa a regional identity and global presence. The Campaign was first launched in East Africa during the 2010 AITEC East Africa ICT Summit held from 7â8 September 2010 in Nairobi, Kenya.  Sophia Bekele, the executive director, DotConnectAfrica made the announcement during the summit in her Keynote speech Since, the Yes2dotafrica campaign has gained recognition and been given credence as a platform for advocacy of the benefits of DotAfrica gTLD and technology transfer and received a very high number of global media coverage


In December 2011, DCA reported that over 3600 potential registrants had preregistered with DCA as part of its promotional campaign jointly with United Domain. DCA also said in its application to ICANN that, if granted the right to administer the .africa TLD, DCA would set prices at levels competitive with the popular .com TLD: about $10 for the domains


Other trust programs identified by DCA include Miss.africa, Generation.africa and driving the capacity of the African ccTLDs.


DotConnectAfrica announced in June 2012 that it had made an agreement with CentralNic, a domain name registrar in the United Kingdom, to provide registry services for the .africa TLD.  DCA also reached agreements with Safaricom and Fincom to provide co-location for the hardware necessary to run the .africa registry.


After the AUC gave an early endorsement to DotConnectAfrica to establish a .africa registry, the same AUC department, Infrastructure and Energy, which wrote a support letter of support for DCA application, turned around and expressed a new interest to get the TLD for itself. Then, the African Union Commission issued a statement on May 12, 2010, referencing the endorsement letter issued by Chairman Jean Ping to DCA, and stated that they would work with ICANN and other internet stakeholders to go through an open process to determine the implementation of .africa.


Nearly a year later, the AUC organized an ""AU DotAfrica Task Force"" (members drawn from the African Internet Community, but that did not include DCA members), and issued yet another letter after the prior one to DCA, stating that the AU did not support nor endorse any individual or organization and announced that entities interested must submit their Expression of Interest (EOI), which would serve as the commission's basis for endorsement and selection. DCA criticized AUC's plan to issue an EOI for an endorsement process, stating AUC's objective for accountability and transparency was ""hollow and unbelievable,"" as their EOI fails to acknowledge the previous endorsement issued to DCA by the AUC. Furthermore, DCA pointed out that the EOI process would be biased, as the AU Task Force had already expressed its support for AfTLD during the 2011 annual African ccTLD event in Ghana. Additionally the AU Task force members are the same individuals who have vested interest in the outcome of the .africa as the members are compiled of the individuals that have registered a ""dotafrica.org"" domain and have claimed to be the competition for DCA's initiative.


During the ICANN 46 International meeting in October  2011 in Dakar Senegal, DCA opposed the reservation of the names .africa, .afrique and .afriqya, suggestions that had been forwarded by the AUC and the AU DotAfrica Task Force, after the ministerial round table that preceded the Senegal ICANN meeting DCA strongly objected to this proposal by voicing its opinion during the ICANN Dakar public forum meeting directly to the ICANN Board as well as in writing to ICANN.  DCA stated the addition of these names to ICANN's reserved list would have jeopardized the .Africa applications in the current new gTLD opening from being applied to by any applicant as per ICANN's gTLD guidebook The reservation of these names to the AUC would have meant that all the applications of the .africa gTLD would have been annulled and there would not be any competition to the .Africa gTLD at the ICANN level, as the names will be reserved for the AUC under a legislative protection for their own use as the AUC is requesting.  After a period of time, DCA's requested for a public written response from ICANN on this issue and ICANN responded on March 8, 2012, to the CommuniquÃ© presented by the AU officials during the Pre-Senegal Ministerial roundtable  and eventually the names were not reserved, making DCA victorious on this issue


Failing to get the name directly reserved by ICANN in response to the Dakar request, in January 2013, the African Union Commission directly appointed a South African company UniForum to administer the .africa TLD on behalf of Africa. This was contested by DCA as quite misleading giving the reason that a firm cannot be selected to administer a domain that has not yet been delegated. Then the African Union Commission issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) and endorsed the same South African company as a preferred applicant for .africa, stating that it went through an international competitive bid in an open and transparent process. DotConnectAfrica stated the AU RFP to select a Registry was issued shortly after Dakar meeting in December and an award was made in January, an incredibly short period of evaluation time compared to what even ICANN registry selection process for an applicant would take nearly 6 â8 months.  Additionally, the AU RFP imposed a ""community application restrictions"" which is not in line with the ICANN RFP for a gTLD applicant, making it impossible for any serious applicant to legitimately participate in the process, except Uniform that was directly recommended by the Chairman of the AFTLD (African Top Level Domain Name organization) who also runs the South African .ZA authority, as well as whose organization is represented at the AU DotAfrica TaskForce. Therefore, DCA contested that the entire RFP should be null and void as it is illegitimate and the members full of conflict of interest. Thereafter, DCA challenged the AU to fully disclose several issues in the greater interest of global public transparency and accountability"" and release the details of its (dot)Africa EOI process and the RFP. DCA also submitted this issues to ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee


The DotAfrica .africa gTLD application was submitted by DCA Trust during the application window that opened on 12 January 2012 and closed on 22 May 2012. DCA hopes to win the mandate from ICANN for the management of the .africa gTLD to enable it administer this resource on behalf of its Pan-African constituency and other stakeholders around the globe.


DCA Trust has made explicit commitment in its .africa application to ICANN that the Trust will establish a full-service Internet registry which will be operated by DCA Registry Services Ltd. in accordance with the technical and operational criteria and other specifications stipulated by ICANN in the new gTLD Applicants' Guidebook.


In its response to comments for competitive applicants, DCA wrote its official response to the Evaluators of ICANN that the application for Uniforum should be disqualified as it does not meet the legal, financial and endorsement criteria that followed the ICANN guidebook. Amongst many of its comments, most significantly DCA criticized that Uniforum's application submitted as co-applicant with AU has given the rights of the database and Intellectual property to the AU in a separate contract as such policy is against ICANNs new gTLD requirements, despite the AUC not even  being alegal applicant, just to get public support from African governments. Additionally DCA noted that uniforum provided an Understated Registry COI Amount and therefore UniForum does not pass the Financial Evaluation Criteria for the COI, if the actual COI amount provided by UniForum has been deliberately understated and that the amount is grossly insufficient to cater for the necessary user and registrant protection from possible risks of .AFRICA registry failure (or business failure of UniForum ZA Central Registry).


In February 2013, not getting response to the communication sent to ICANN and the African Union  DCA appealed to members of the U.S. Congress in February, 2013. DCA wrote and reiterated their issues with the manner in which UniForum received and carried out the AU's endorsement. DCA notes that it does not feel there are sufficient mechanisms for appeal or dealing with illegalities over the new gTLD program and requested the U.S. Congress to intervene immediately to appoint an independent New gTLD Ombudsman for the entire ICANN New gTLD program, where such grievances will be heard and addressed 


On November 20, 2012, the AUC failing to get the .africa string names reserved, they followed the advice given by the ICANN Board in their reply to the AU communiquÃ©, that states  ""While ICANN is not able to offer the specific relief requested in the CommuniquÃ©, the robust protections built into the New gTLD Program afford the African Union (and its individual member states), through the Government Advisory Committee, the opportunity to raise concerns that an applicant is seen as potentially sensitive or problematic, or provide direct advice to the Board. In addition, the African Union (and its individual member states) can avail itself of any of the appropriate objection processes mentioned above in the event an application is received for any string â even those beyond representations of .Africa â that may raise concern"" and so  filed an ""early warning"" objecting to DCA's application for the dotAfrica TLD with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Therefore, the objection by the AUC stated that ""the application fails to meet the minimum requirements prescribed by ICANN in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook concerning geographic names""  and that


DCA's application constitutes an unwarranted intrusion and interference with the mandate given to the AUC by African Head of States and African Ministers responsible for Communication and Information Technologies. In this regard the AUC has been mandated to establish dotAfrica (.Africa) as a continental Top-Level Domain for use by organisations, businesses and individuals with guidance from African Internet Agencies and in doing so to set up the structures and modalities for the implementation of the dotAfrica (.Africa) project. DCA's persistent interference in this process is likely to have substantive political, economic and social repercussions in Africa.


Identical early warnings of objection were filed with the GAC by the governments of Comoros, Kenya, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Benin, Egypt, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Morocco, Uganda, Senegal, South Africa, Nigeria, and Tanzania.


Beijing GAC objection: The ICANN meeting in Beijing China set the ground for some of the new gTLD procedures to continue, GAC Advice was part of the communiquÃ© that saw several strings receive varying responses to their applications. The results of the GAC advice though attracted wide criticism from the internet fraternity as to how some of the decisions were reached. DotConnectAfrica application received a GAC Objection advice to which they submitted a response following guidelines of the guidebook  The New gTLD Program Committee, which is part of the ICANN Board subsequently gave recommendation that the GAC advice be followed, which essential is the Board's advise, DCA critiqued in their reply to GAC.  DCA then refused to withdraw, its application before accountability hearing is completed, against the backdrop that the ICANN Board decision was ""unfair, discriminatory, and lacked appropriate due diligence and care"" as well as ""anti-competitive"" to their application and organizational aspirations.


After the objection, DotConnectAfrica refused to back down and contacted the African Union and ICANN.
DCA also requested for a Reconsideration which ICANN denied prompting that organization to begin the Independent Review Process. The IRP is a proceeding provided for in Article IV, Section 3 of the ICANN Bylaws, by which any person materially affected by a decision or action of the ICANN Board may request that the action be reviewed by an independent third party for consistency with the ICANN Bylaws and/or Articles of Incorporation and is governed by the International Dispute Resolution Procedures of the ICDR and the Supplementary Procedures for ICANN IRP Process.


On March 26, 2014 at the ICANN Singapore meeting ICANN signed a controversial contract with ZACR, despite IRP proceedings with DCA, which received criticisms against such actions by some African public media.


On May 12, 2014 DCA won an injunction against ICANN in its IRP Proceedings in an arbitration process. The Injunction ruled that ""ICANN must immediately refrain from any further processing of any application for .africa until this Panel has heard the merits of DCA's Trust Notice of Independent Review Process and issued its final decision regarding the same"". ICANN had on March 24, 2014 proceeded to sign a contract with ZACR who are competitors for the "".africa"" string, sparking an outrage that ICANN was continually mistreating DCA Trust. DCA is represented by an international law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP based in New York while ICANN is represented by a Los Angeles-based Law Firm Jones Day LLC, which has been working with ICANN nearly since its inception 


On 14 August 2014, The IRP panel  issued a Thirty Three (33) Pages ruling  to accept DotConnectAfrica's position on the procedural framework of the IRP proceedings. The Panel has ruled terming its Declaration and the future Declaration on the Merits of the case are binding on ICANN. (ICANN wanted this to be ""advisory"" and not ""binding) 


On 9th July 2015, DCA Trust won in the DCA Vs ICANN .Africa IRP. DCA Trust was declared the prevailing party. The ICANN Board on 16 July 2015 called a special meeting consider the  independent review panel's declaration that held in favor of DotConnectAfrica Trust , the board resolved that DCA's application would be taken back to evaluation.
Part of the IRP panel's recommendations are as follows:


148 Based on the foregoing, after having carefully reviewed the Partiesâ written submissions, listened to the testimony of the three witness, listened to the oral submissions of the Parties in various telephone conference calls and at the in-person hearing of this IRP in Washington, D.C. on 22 and 23 May 2015, and finally after much deliberation, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 11 (c) of ICANN's Bylaws, the Panel declares that both the actions and inactions of the Board with respect to the application of DCA Trust relating to the .AFRICA gTLD were inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of ICANN.


149 Furthermore, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 11 (d) of ICANN's Bylaws, the Panel recommends that ICANN continue to refrain from delegating the .AFRICA gTLD and permit DCA Trust's application to proceed through the remainder of the new gTLD application process.


150 The Panel declares DCA Trust to be the prevailing party in this IRP and further declares that ICANN is to bear, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 18 of the Bylaws, Article 11 of Supplementary Procedures and Article 31 of the ICDR Rules, the totality of the costs of this IRP and the totality of the costs of the IRP Provider 


The documents of this IRP can be found on DCA's website


DotConnectAfrica Trust took ICANN to Court on January 20, 2016 following a disagreement on how ICANN processed the IRP ruling that was declared DCA Trust the prevailing party on July 9, 2015. DCA Trust submitted its first Amended Notice on 26 February 2016.


A United States District Court, Central District Of California - Western Division on March 4, 2016 in a ruling granted an Interim Relief for DotConnectAfrica in a decision [PDF Case No: CV 16-00862 RGK (JCx)]     that ICANN should hold off from delegating the .AFRICA top-level domain (TLD) for ZA Central Registry (ZACR.


The Court ruling stated:


(IN CHAMBERS) Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for TRO (DE ) by Judge R. Gary Klausner: The Court grants Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for TRO. Defendant is enjoined from issuing the .Africa gTLD until the Court decides Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, scheduled for hearing on April 4, 2016.


Upon review of the parties' arguments, the Court finds serious questions going to the merits. Plaintiff has demonstrated that once the gTLD is issued, it will be unable to obtain those rights elsewhere. Moreover, the injury it will suffer cannot be compensated through monetary damages. In opposition, Defendant states in conclusory fashion only that the African governments and the ICANN community will suffer prejudice if the delegation of the gTLD is delayed.


The Temporary Restraining Order will allow the Court time to consider arguments from DotConnectAfrica Trust (DCA Trust) and ICANN regarding the .AFRICA TLD. DCA Trust is represented by Brown, Neri, Smith  & Khan LLP in the case 


On April 12, 2016, the same court also granted a Preliminary Injunction for DotConnectAfrica, the decision for case no. 16-CV-00862 RGK (JCx) [PDF]  The ruling detailed among other things that The balance of equities tips in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. Without preliminary injunction, DCA will lose the opportunity to obtain rights to .Africa because ICANN will likely delegate the rights to ZACR prior to the conclusion of this action, and these rights can be delegated only once.


The ruling also shed light on the AUC relationship with ICANN stating that public interest favors granting preliminary injunction, that The AUC's relationship with ZACR, and its interest in preventing the delay of issuing rights to .Africa creates a conflict of interest. Therefore, on this point, the Court accords little weight to the Yedaly Declaration. On balance, the Court finds it more prejudicial to the African community, and the international community in general, if the delegation of .Africa is made prior to a determination on the fairness of the process by which it was delegated.",1,27 December 2010, 9 August 2021,467,0,0

It is believed this church was built in the 13th century after the Reconquista of the city of Tavira from Moors. The church was built as an initiative of the Order of Santiago (1242) by D. Paio Peres Correia to replace the Arab mosque that existed here. The mosque is believed to have served the Medina (fortified city) of Tavira. The mosques existence hasn't been proven archaeologically. However, in 1718, a tomb was found with a corpse and an Alfange (type of Moorish sword). At the time, it was decided to bury it again with the Alfange.

They were designed by William Martley for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), and built at the LCDR's Longhedge works during 1865, using components from the Sondes class 4-4-0ST locomotives, including the boilers.


In November 1875, William Kirtley (who had replaced Martley following the latter's death in 1874) allotted the class letter F. During 1876â78, the locomotives were rebuilt with new boilers and cylinders; at the same time they were given numbers, the names being removed. They passed to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) at the start of 1899, and their numbers were increased by 459 to avoid duplication with former South Eastern Railway locomotives. New boilers were again provided in 1905â07, but all six locomotives were withdrawn in 1909.


The names were all retained from the Sondes class.

Kabyles:


Troupes coloniales:


The First Battle of Boudouaou in May 1837, during the French conquest of Algeria, pitted the troupes coloniales under Colonel Maximilien Joseph Schauenburg against the troops of Kabylia of the Igawawen.


When Emir Abdelkader was preparing to negotiate a truce with the French invaders in 1837 in order to devote himself to building his Emirate which would then encircle the Casbah of Algiers, he then stepped up his attacks against agricultural farms and French military posts in Mitidja to balance the balance of power to its advantage.


He then set up his command center in Titteri mountain range and, from 8 May 1837, caused an insurrection of the Kabyles of the Khachna mountain range, the Beni AÃ¯cha region and the Issers plain to the east of the rich plain of Mitidja.


This is how the attack on the Mercier farm in RÃ©ghaÃ¯a by the rebels commanded by Emir Mustapha, brother of Emir Abdelkader, was going to create an already fragile military shift between the French soldiers and the Kabyle rebels who had imposed themselves and content to reign east of the Oued BoudouaouÂ [ar] since the fall of power in Algiers during 1830.


This attack was followed by looting and sacking of this agricultural farm overlooking the Kabyle country, and this upheaval at the gates of Algiers forced Governor General Charles-Marie Denys de DamrÃ©mont and his lieutenant General Alexandre Charles PerrÃ©gaux to undertake a military expedition on 17 May 1837. on the Beni AÃ¯cha and the Issers to counter the allies of Emir Abdelkader and push them back towards the eastern shore of Oued Isser.


The bitter failure that Colonel Maximilien Joseph Schauenburg suffered during the expedition to the Col des Beni AÃ¯cha during the day of 18 May 1837 because of the bad weather which had fallen on his military column in this spring season and because of its ignorance of the marshy and bushy terrain of the Beni AÃ¯cha region around Meraldene River, dealt a terrible blow to the morale of the troupes coloniales engaged in the expedition, but also to the soldiers who had remained stationed in a military camp in the joint ownership of Boudouaou.


The Kabyles of Beni AÃ¯cha under the direction of the marabout Cheikh Ali Boushaki had been reinforced and backed up by the reinforcements arrived from Laazib Zamoum under the direction of Cheikh Ben Zamoum, and who all together thwarted the expedition of Colonel Schauenburg who is then withdrawn in the haste and the rout towards the camp of Boudouaou to spare its troops of a programmed and imminent decimation.


When Colonel Schauenburg brought back from the Col des Beni AÃ¯cha on 19 May 1837 his three thousand soldiers to the Boudouaou camp by a very strong sustained march to flee the Kabyles who were defending their land, they then found a supply convoy there to meet their food needs.


Indeed, the failure of the first expedition to Kabylia was also due to the non-arrival of General PerrÃ©gaux who had been prevented from landing on the shore of Zemmouri El Bahri near the mouth of Oued Merdja with his thousand soldiers and provisions of food, and this because of the storm which had hit the Bay of AlgiersÂ [fr] and which prevented his ship from reaching the shores of Kabylia.


The Boudouaou camp allowed these French soldiers to withdraw safely after having consumed all their food which was only enough for three days of expedition, and this supply convoy found in Boudouaou fell at the peak to fill the bags of the soldiers who had emptied in those cold and harsh days.


Colonel Schauenburg took on his return from the valley of Oued Meraldene to Boudouaou a winding path along the Mediterranean sea near the mouth of Oued CorsoÂ [ar] in order to guard and protect the rear and flanks of his military troop.


But when the French column was going to dodge the harassment of the rebels which had lasted since the morning, and was going to arrive at a natural fountain to quench their thirst before reaching Boudouaou, the kabyles of Cheikh Ali Boushaki and of Cheikh Ben Zamoum attempted a double attack on Schauenburg's troops.


Indeed, the Amraoua cavalry undertook a lateral attack on the beach of the sea of Boudouaou El Bahri, while the Kabyle infantry of the Beni AÃ¯cha was stationed on the heights to surround and attack the French invaders.


Colonel Schauenburg had guessed this movement of the Kabyles, and he ordered fire shells to be fired from two pieces of mountain, and to launch scuffles of the infantry which was ambushed.


This French response then stopped the Kabyle riders, while an offensive return of the soldiers was carried out trying to outflank the Kabyles, and this gave the column time to cross the parade which preceded the haven of peace of Boudouaou.


The Kabyles temporarily contented themselves with tracking down the French to Boudouaou and did not continue their pursuit to the military camp.


General DamrÃ©mont took advantage of this escapade and this withdrawal, hoping that the Kabyle uprising was going to abort, and believed to be able to have military troops to promote an expedition to the West of Algeria to reinforce General Thomas Robert Bugeaud (1784â1849).


But DamrÃ©mont did not order to leave the valley of Boudouaou, and he wanted to perpetuate the French presence at the entrance of Kabylia by permanently threatening the Beni AÃ¯cha and the Issers, and this by the establishment of a fortified and entrenched camp at Boudouaou, which is a strategic position equidistant from the various valleys of Sebaou, Issers and Meraldene on the one hand and the Mitidja plain on the other.


From 8 May to 25 May 1837, the Emir Abdelkader forced General DamrÃ©mont to mobilize a garrison and a body of troops stationed in the Boudouaou camp in a stronghold at the entrance to Kabylia in order to defend Algiers against a possible attack by rebels and Kabyle dissidents.


These hundreds of French soldiers posted and exposed in the Boudouaou ravine were already a sign of success for Emir Abdelkader to have forced the French to build one more isolated military post, with all the embarrassments and all the dangers to the soldiers involved in each new sedentary establishment.


The garrison that was maintained at Boudouaou was made up of only one battalion, which was a latent and indirect victory for the Kabyle who hoped for a more striking and immediate triumph by attacking this reduced number of French soldiers who had been left behind on the spot to raise the redoubt.


The leaders of the Kabyle coalition, Cheikh Ali Boushaki and Cheikh Ben Zamoum, did not miss such a great opportunity to attack with superior Algerian forces this weak detachment of French soldiers, before their work of building the camp of Boudouaou protected and sheltered them from rebel attacks.


The construction and the shoulder of the camp had still very little to be completed, when at sunrise of 25 May 1837 about five thousand five hundred (5.500) Kabyles on foot and five hundred (500) horsemen on horseback appeared on the east bank of the Oued Boudouaou, in front of the French bivouac.


The French soldiers surprised in the camp by the Kabyle attack were then commanded by the battalion chief the Commandant Antoine de La TorrÃ© (1787-1851), of the 2nd light regiment, and they were then only nine hundred (900) infantrymen, of the 2nd light regiment and 48th line regiment, and forty-five (45) riders on horse, of the 1st hunter regiment, with two mountain howitzers supplied with four shots.

7467283,Children of Paul's,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Paul%27s,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children_of_Paul's&action=info,"The Children of Paul's was the name of a troupe of boy actors in Elizabethan and Jacobean London. Along with the Children of the Chapel, they were an important of the companies of boy players that constituted a distinctive feature of English Renaissance theatre.


The youth who would become choirboys and boy players for the Children of Paul's ranged in age from six to their mid-teens. They would be educated and boarded at the choir school, trained in not only singing but in grammar and literacy. Although their basic needs were taken care of, choirboys sometimes made some money for themselves. When fashionably dressed men wearing spurs, which could be loud and distracting to other church-goers, would enter the chapel, the choirboys would sometimes demand money as a fee. This fee was called ""spur money"". Choirboys were allowed time to play on Thursday afternoons, and in one document from 1598, a verger named John Howe notes an occasion when the boys broke windows and disrupted churchgoers.


St. Paul's Cathedral in London had a boys' choir since the 12th century; it was only in the 16th century that they began to act in dramatic performances. Playing may have become a part of the boys' education as a result of the influence of humanist teachings, which encouraged students to ""develop poise and improve their skill in speaking Latin by acting""


In 1527â1528, the Children of Paul's performed for King Henry VIII, and for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.


Sebastian Westcott was Master of the Children of Paul's in the years 1557â82; in his era, the boys performed 27 times at court, more than any other troupe, adult or child. In 1560â1572 Master of the Revels Sir Thomas Benger used them throughout his tenure, as later mentioned in William Shakespeare' play Hamlet, Act 2 Scene 2. One example is when the company performed for Queen Elizabeth and her guest at the time, Cecilia of Sweden, in 1566. They performed a play by Sixt Birk, called Sapientia Solomonis, which ""dramatized the relationship between King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in a way appropriate for schoolboys"". Under Master Thomas Giles (1584â1599?), the Children of Paul's became closely identified with the plays of John Lyly; they performed at Court nine times in the years 1587â90. The boys acted Lyly's Gallathea at Court, probably on 1 January 1588; they acted his Endymion at Court a month and a day later, on 2 February; and his Midas on 6 January 1590. Other of Lyly's plays, Mother Bombie and Love's Metamorphosis, were also presented at Court in these years.


Also in the 1580s the Children of Paul's joined the Children of the Chapel in public performances at the first Blackfriars Theatre (1583â1584), a foretaste of the period of public performance that was to follow for both companies at the start of the 17th century.


In 1590, the Children of Paul's were implicated in the Martin Marprelate controversy, as not only were they associated with John Lyly, they had ""helped to publicise his contributions"". All theatre companies, including adult ones, were forced to curb their productions. Boy companies became scarce until the Children of Paul's returned a decade later in 1599â1600. By the time of its reopening, the Children of Paul's may have had up to 17 boy players (84 Roslyn Lander Knutson). For the next ten years the boy companies were out of fashion on the stage.


By 1600, conditions had changed; a new Master, Edward Peers (died 1612), allowed the Children of Paul's to resume acting, and apparently faced no significant opposition. The company operated on a smaller scale than before, though only playing on Sundays and Mondays and charging half the amount for the attendance fee than they had in 1590. The anonymous plays The Maid's Metamorphosis and The Wisdom of Doctor Dodypoll illustrate the kind of drama the boys acted in their first year. The Children of Paul's performed the works of John Marston, George Chapman, and Thomas Middleton, among other dramatists of their generation. Marston was mainly identified with the Children of Paul's, as Jonson was identified with the Children of the Chapel; in the Poetomachia, the War of the Theatres of 1599â1601, the Children of Paul's acted Marston's side of the contest, with the plays Jack Drum's Entertainment (1600) and What You Will (1601), plus Thomas Dekker's Satiromastix (1601).


However, unlike the Children of the Chapel, who worked in the second Blackfriars Theatre, the Children of Paul's had no dedicated theatrical space of their own. When they were not playing at Court, they acted in the church where they trained as choristers â St Gregory by St Paul's Church, just to the south-west of St Paul's Cathedral. This tended to limit their drama; sometimes plays had to be cut short to accommodate the schedules of the religious institutions in the middle of which the boy players operated.


The Children of Paul's ceased playing about 1606 for unclear reasons. Some scholars have believed that the King's Revels Children, another company that formed c. 1606, might have been to some degree the Children of Paul's under another name, but this is uncertain. (The King's Revels Children never gelled as an enterprise; they collapsed in litigation among their backers in 1609.)


However it could also be that the company simply merged with the Children of the Blackfriars, rather than disappearing altogether.

The initial plant was two 2.5MW BTH/English Electric turbo alternators that were no longer needed at Ultimo power station. A third 2.5MW turbo alternator from Zarra Street, Newcastle was added in 1931. A fourth 2.5MWBTH machine was installed in 1936 (ex Zarra St). In 1943 a 2.5MW Willans & Robinson generator from Zarra St became No5 at Lithgow. Steam was supplied from four 160,000Â lb/Hr boilers at 200PSI and a temp of 450degF. Coal came from the nearby State Mine. Due to a severe lack of water, these turbines only exhausted into individual jet condensers.


The second stage of Lithgow power station development started in 1948 with the removal of No5 which had been damaged and the installation of a 7.5MW Metro-Vickers alternator from Zarra St and became No4A. Similar 7.5MW Metro Vickers generators replaced the 2.5MW machines in 1950, 1953 and 1956 to become No. 3A, No. 5, No. 2 and No. 1. Steam was supplied from five 70,000Â lb/hr boilers that were ex White Bay ""A"" station. A series of wooden cooling towers were constructed and allowed the use of surface condensers for these larger sets. Make-up for the cooling towers came from a new dam built at the adjacent State Mine. Total output was 38MW.

In the LDS Church, the word ""ordinance"" is used approximately as the word sacrament is used in many other denominations of Christianity. In the LDS Church, the sacrament is a specific ordinance. Latter-day Saint adherents regard partaking of the sacrament to be a commandment of Jesus Christ; participating in it demonstrates a willingness to remember the atonement of Jesus Christ.


In each congregation of the LDS Church, the sacrament is offered on a weekly basis during sacrament meeting; the sacrament is not provided during general and stake conferences. As most males in the church age 16 years and older can perform the ordinance, church congregations may send men to the homes of sick or housebound members in order to provide them with the sacrament. Fathers of families occasionally perform the ordinance with their families during times of illness or travel, but this requires the approval of the local bishop or branch president and is not intended to replace the regular attendance of public sacrament meetings. In areas lacking an organized church presence or in times when meeting is impossible, a priesthood holder in the household generally administers the sacrament to his family and possibly to others nearby who do not have a priesthood holder in the home.


In LDS sacrament meetings, the sacrament is passed to members of the congregation after being blessed by a priest from the Aaronic priesthood or a member of the Melchizedek priesthood. The sacrament table is prepared before the meeting begins, usually by teachers, by placing whole slices of bread on trays and filling small individual water cups, which are also held in trays. Both bread and water trays are then covered with white cloth. After introductory prayers, administrative business, and announcements, the sacrament portion of the service begins. It is customary for the congregation to sing a hymn while the bread is uncovered and prepared. The congregation remains seated while the priesthood representatives stand and break bread into bite-sized pieces. The breaking of the bread represents the broken body of Christ. After breaking the bread and the conclusion of the hymn, the priesthood holder kneels and says a set prayer on the broken bread. The bread is passed to the congregation by priesthood holders, usually by deacons. The prayer on the bread is found in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants:


After the bread is passed to the congregation, the bread trays are placed on the table and covered with the white cloth. The water trays are then uncovered and a set prayer is given on the water, which is then passed to the congregation. The prayer on the water indicates that the water represents the shed blood of Christ:


After the water is passed to the congregation, the water trays are covered with the bread trays for the remainder of the service. Usually, those who have prepared the bread and water prior to the meeting have the responsibility of disposing of them after the meeting. The leftover bread and water are discarded. Latter-day Saints  believe the bread and water to be symbols, not the actual body and blood of Christ;  therefore, discarding blessed bread and water is not considered sacrilegious.


The sacramental prayers are different from most other prayers in the LDS Church in that they must be recited verbatim. If the person blessing the sacrament makes a mistake and does not correct himself, the bishop or branch president will signal that the prayer must be repeated until recited correctly.


As introduced by the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith, the sacrament included the use of fermented wine, though the church now uses water.


Following what adherents believe came in an 1830 revelation given to Smith not to purchase alcohol from enemies, the church focused on producing its own wine, eventually owning and operating vineyards and wineries in Utah Territory and California during the 19th century.


In 1833, Smith said he received the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom, part of which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, with the exception of sacramental wine. Initially, the Word of Wisdom was treated as a recommendation, and the early Latter Day Saints would still drink alcohol. During the late-19th century, church leaders began to interpret the Word of Wisdom as a requirement for membership. This increased respect for the Word of Wisdom, combined with other scriptures in Doctrine and Covenants, led congregations to begin substituting water for the sacramental wine. The practice was officially adopted church-wide in 1912.


Occasionally, a lack of access to bread will result in the use of food other than bread in the sacrament. For instance, after the Second World War, members in Switzerland, under heavy food rationing, ""were so anxious to partake of the sacrament that they purchased some potato peelings which cost fifty dollars and used these in place of bread.""


â³But neither teachers nor deacons have authority to baptize, administer the sacrament, or lay on handsâ³ (Doctrine and Covenants 20:58).

On March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders of the church announced a temporary suspension of all large meetings for members of the church worldwide, including weekly sacrament meetings, which is effective until further notice. Among the instructions given during this period of time was the directive that the bishops of each congregation ensure that those over whom they have stewardship receive the sacrament at least once a month during this period of time.


The sacrament is viewed by adherents as a renewal of a member's covenant made at baptism. According to the sacramental prayers, a person eats and drinks in remembrance of the body and blood of Jesus, promises to always remember Him, take His name upon them, and keep His commandments. In return, the prayer promises that the participant will always have the Spirit to be with them.


The sacrament is considered the most sacred and important element of normal Sabbath day observance and as such is approached by Latter-day Saints with reverence and in a spirit of penitence. Consequently, all who partake of the sacrament are encouraged to examine their own consciences and prayerfully gauge their own worthiness to do so. If they feel unworthy, they are encouraged to refrain from participating in the sacrament until they have properly repented of their sins. Partaking of the sacrament by non-members and unbaptized members is permissible (except in cases were the person has been excommunicated by the church), but the unbaptized are regarded as not having part of the covenant associated with the sacrament.",1,1 December 2003, 22 May 2021,297,0,0

Fabre Line ordered Patria and her sister ship SSÂ Providence from SociÃ©tÃ© Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la MÃ©diterranÃ©e of La Seyne-sur-Mer, near Toulon. Patria had seven decks and three funnels, but one of the funnels was a dummy. Patria had nine boilers feeding two three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines. The cylinder bores were 30.4"" (high pressure), 49.36"" (medium pressure) and 70.55"" (low pressure), all with a stroke of 51.2"". The engines gave Patria a total of 900 NHP and propelled the ship by twin screws. Patria had direction finding equipment and was the first ocean liner to be equipped with a cinema.


Patria was launched on 11 November 1913 and entered Fabre Line service on 15 or 16 April 1914.


The New York Times reported that a German submarine attacked her on 1 March 1916 off the coast of Tunis. There is no naval record of such an attack, so it is not clear what incident may have taken place. However, the captain of the ship at the time, Pierre Deschelles, stated in an affidavit that while he didn't see the German submarine, members of the crew and many passengers did.


She plied as a transatlantic liner between Marseille and New York from then until 1920, when she and Providence were reassigned to carrying emigrants to New York from Naples, Palermo and Marseille. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Messageries Maritimes withdrew Patria from the emigrant trade in 1930, although Providence continued to carry emigrants until 1932.


On 19 January 1932, Fabre Line leased Patria for eight years to Messageries Maritimes, who placed her in service between the Levant and the south of France. Later that year, off the Ionian island of Zakynthos, Patria rescued three survivors from the sinking of a Greek vessel, the Tinios Stavtos. A Greek merchant ship, SSÂ Heron, rescued 25 survivors from the same incident. In 1934 Patria grounded on a bank while entering the Port of Alexandria in Egypt. In February 1939 Patria served as a hospital ship in the Spanish Civil War.


On 1 January 1940, Fabre Line sold Patria to Messageries Maritimes. On 6 June 1940 she entered the Port of Haifa after sailing from Beirut. On 10 June Italy declared war on France and the UK. Any Allied ship passing Italy to reach France would now be in danger of attack, so Patria remained in port in Haifa.


On 22 June 1940, France surrendered to Germany, and on 25 June the British Mandatory Palestine authorities barred Patria from leaving Haifa. The British authorities seized Patria on 15 August and placed her under the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Co. She was assigned to be a troop ship, authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew). She still had only enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with liferafts.


Despite her new designation Patria remained laid up in Haifa until the beginning of November 1940. In that month the Royal Navy intercepted three chartered ships; the SSÂ Pacific, SSÂ Milos and SSÂ Atlantic, that were carrying Jewish refugees from German-occupied Europe to Palestine. The refugees lacked permits to enter Palestine so the British authorities ordered their deportation to British Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Refugees from Pacific and Milos had been put aboard Patria, and embarkation of refugees from Atlantic had begun, when on 25 November a bomb planted by a Haganah agent blew a hole in the side of Patria's hull. She listed to that side and sank in 16 minutes, settling on the harbour bed with part of her hull and superstructure above water.


By the time of the attack almost 1,800 refugees had been embarked aboard Patria, along with a crew of 130 and numerous British guards. The majority of those aboard were rescued but 172 were injured and between 260 and 300 were killed. The majority of victims were Jewish refugees but about 50 were crew and British guards; 209 bodies were recovered and buried in Haifa.


Patria remained a wreck in Haifa port until 1952, when she was scrapped.",0,1 March 2013, 24 May 2021,67,0,0
193854,I Want to Live!,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Live!,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Want_to_Live!&action=info,"I Want to Live! is a 1958 American biographical film noir directed by Robert Wise, and starring Susan Hayward, Simon Oakland, Virginia Vincent, and Theodore Bikel. It follows the life of Barbara Graham, a prostitute and habitual criminal who is convicted of murder and faces capital punishment. The screenplay, written by Nelson Gidding and Don Mankiewicz, was adapted from personal letters written by Graham, in addition to newspaper articles written by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ed Montgomery. The film presents a highly fictionalized version of the case, indicating the possibility of that Graham may have been innocent.


Released in late 1958, I Want to Live! was a commercial and critical success, garnering favorable reviews from critics for both Hayward's performance as well as the film's realistic depiction of capital punishment. The film earned a total of six Academy Award nominations, with Hayward winning a Best Actress Oscar at the 31st Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award in the same category.


In 1950 San Francisco, petty criminal and prostitute Barbara Graham faces a misdemeanor charge for soliciting sex. She returns to her native San Diego, but is soon charged with perjury after she provides two criminal friends a false alibi. She subsequently returns to sex work and other criminal activities to make a living. She begins working for thief Emmett Perkins by luring men to his gambling parlor. Barbara manages to earn a significant amount of money, and quits working for Emmett to marry Hank, her third husband. The couple have a son, Bobby, but their marriage is turbulent due to Hank's drug addiction, which leaves him jobless.


Barbara throws Hank out of her house, but is subsequently evicted. Desperate, she leaves Bobby in the care of her mother and returns to working for Emmett, who is now associated with thugs John Santo and Bruce King. Police eventually crack down on the operation, and Barbara surrenders. During the interrogation, however, she is stunned when authorities accuse her of helping Perkins and Santo murder Mabel Monahan, an elderly Burbank woman. Barbara insists she was home with her husband and son the night of the murder, but is indicted by a grand jury. Barbara's childhood friend, Peg, visits her in jail, and agrees to help care for Bobby.


Attorney Richard Tibrow is assigned to Barbara's case, and informs her that her alibi is meaningless unless Hank can corroborate it. Barbara foolishly accepts a phony alibi from Ben Miranda, a friend of her jail mate, Rita. Ben insists that Barbara admit she helped with the murder before agreeing to provide the alibi, and she reluctantly implicates herself. During the trial, Hank refutes Barbara's alibi, and a taped recording of her confession, made by Ben during their meeting, is used as evidence against her. Barbara insists that she sought the phony alibi only to avoid the death penalty, and that her admission is false. She is ultimately convicted, along with Emmett and John; all three are sentenced to death.


Tibrow withdraws from Barbara's case and is replaced by Al Matthews. In prison, Barbara is relentlessly defiant, refusing to wear her uniform and demanding a radio. Matthews has psychologist Carl Palmberg evaluate Barbara in the hopes of ultimately administering a lie detection test. After visiting with her, Carl states that while Barbara appears to be amoral, she is averse to violence; he also points out that she is left-handed, and the bludgeoning death of Mabel was committed by a right-handed person. Journalist Edward Montgomery, who has covered Barbara's case since the beginning, begins questioning her conviction, and starts publishing a sympathetic series profiling her troubled life. As her execution date draws near, Barbara grows increasingly anxious. A Supreme Court stay gives her hope that her sentence may be commuted, but it is overturned when Carl dies unexpectedly of heart disease. Al's petition for a retrial is denied, and Barbara's execution date is set.


The day before her execution, a demoralized Barbara is transferred to San Quentin Prison, where she meets with a priest. That evening, she is angered to hear that her son has been put up for adoption. An anxious Barbara stays up all night, wistfully recounting her marriage with Hank to a prison nurse. For her final meal, she requests an ice cream sundae. In the morning, forty-five minutes before Barbara's scheduled execution, California Governor Goodwin J. Knight declares a stay, but Al's writ is struck down and the execution ordered to proceed. Barbara is taken to the gas chamber, but the execution is again halted when Al's amended writ is declared.


The uncertainty and desperation surrounding her fate reduces Barbara to hysterics. She is returned to her cell, where she and the prison staff wait several minutes for a response to Al's writ; they are informed it has again been rejected, and Barbara's execution is ordered to proceed immediately. Before entering the gas chamber, Barbara demands a mask, as she does not want to see the faces of the journalists there. She is strapped to the chair and executed with cyanide gas. After Barbara is pronounced dead, a despondent Edward leaves the prison. On his way out, he is met by Al, who gives him a note from Barbara thanking him for his efforts to help her.


According to historian Kathleen Cairns, I Want to Live! ""implied that Graham's guilt or innocence was largely irrelevant, that the real crime was committed by a justice system that framed her and a media that abetted the effort...Â In reality, the film took liberty with many facts of the case."" The film also suggests that Graham, though believed to have sociopathic tendencies in real life, was rather merely self-destructive due to her loveless childhood and abusive mother.


A prologue and epilogue contributed to the film by Edward Montgomery, the journalist who covered Graham's case, characterize the film's contentâwhich largely portrays Graham as innocent of the murderâas factual. However, there was substantial evidence of Graham's complicity in the crime which included her taped confession to an undercover officer. Hollywood writer Robert Osborne, who later became the host of Turner Classic Movies, interviewed Hayward and asked whether or not she believed Barbara Graham had been innocent. According to Osborne, the actress seemed hesitant to answer at first, but ultimately admitted that her research on the evidence and letters in the case led her to believe that the woman she played was guilty.


Despite some of the liberties taken with Graham's story, the film is generally considered to be very accurate in its depiction of how the California gas chamber functioned in the mid-20th century.


The film's screenplay was originally written by Don Mankiewicz, based on letters by convicted murderer Barbara Graham, executed in 1955, as well as a series of articles by esteemed journalist Edward S. Montgomery. In early 1958, after a draft of the screenplay was completed, Nelson Gidding was commissioned to redraft it and tighten the narrative as it ""lacked focus"" and spent too much time detailing Graham's troubled childhood. Gidding's redrafting also omitted the murder scene of Mable Monohan, as well as Graham's months spent at San Quentin Prison during her appeals.


Susan Hayward was cast in the lead role of Barbara Graham. When questioned on taking the controversial role, Hayward said: ""I just had to play her. If I hadn't thought they should make [the film], I wouldn't have played the part.""


Principal photography of I Want to Live! began in April 1958.


To ensure the execution sequence was depicted as accurately as possible Wise attended a public execution at San Quentin Prison. Hayward commented after completing filming that her simulated experience of execution led her to believe the practice was ""medieval.""


In addition to Mandel's score, the film features jazz themes performed by Gerry Mulligan's Jazz Combo. Two soundtrack albums were released on the United Artists label in 1958.


Some sources state the film grossed $3.5 million, though in the Walter Wanger biography Walter Wanger, Hollywood Independent (2000), the film is said to have grossed $5,641,711, with a net profit of $2,455,570. Star Hayward was entitled to 37% of the film's overall profit.


Upon release, I Want to Live! was met with a largely favorable critical response, with many critics heralding the film as an ""indictment against capital punishment,"" citing its clinical, harrowing depiction of execution. Producer Walter Wanger received numerous congratulatory letters praising the film after its release, namely from writers Arthur Miller, Paddy Chayefsky, Leon Uris, and Albert Camus, all of whom were ardent opponents of capital punishment.


Variety magazine gave the film a favorable review: ""There is no attempt to gloss the character of Barbara Graham, only an effort to understand it through some fine irony and pathos. She had no hesitation about indulging in any form of crime or vice that promised excitement on her own, rather mean, terms... Hayward brings off this complex characterization. Simon Oakland, as Montgomery, who first crucified Barbara Graham in print and then attempted to undo what he had done, underplays his role with assurance.


Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times liked the film and wrote, ""...Miss Hayward plays it superbly, under the consistently sharp direction of Robert Wise, who has shown here a stunning mastery of the staccato realistic style. From a loose and wise-cracking B-girl she moves onto levels of cold disdain and then plunges down to depths of terror and bleak surrender as she reaches the end. Except that the role does not present us a precisely pretty character, its performance merits for Miss Hayward the most respectful applause.""


Gene Blake, the reporter who covered the actual murder trial for the Los Angeles Daily Mirror, and who described how the movie took liberties with the facts, called the movie ""a dramatic and eloquent piece of propaganda for the abolition of the death penalty.""


By March 1959, Billboard noted that the popularity of the film and of Mandel's and Mulligan's albums ""prompted a rush of jazz film scores"", and cited the signing of Duke Ellington to do the score for that year's Anatomy of a Murder, the release of The Five Pennies (a biopic about the jazz band leader Red Nichols), and a 1960 documentary Jazz on a Summer's Day.


In a 1993 re-appraisal, film critic Danny Peary opines that Hayward is ""...the actress of that era [the 1940s and '50s] who most needs rediscovery, and the best film to start with is I Want to Live!.""


The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes currently reports a 92% approval rating based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10.


MGM Home Entertainment released I Want to Live! on DVD for the first time on May 7, 2002. Kino Lorber reissued the film on DVD featuring a restored print in October 2015. In November 2016, Twilight Time released the film on Blu-ray for the first time in an edition limited to 3,000 units.

11193614,AROS Research Operating System,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AROS_Research_Operating_System,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AROS_Research_Operating_System&action=info,"AROS Research Operating System (AROS, pronounced ""AR-OS"") is a free and open-source multi media centric implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 application programming interface (API). Designed to be portable and flexible. As of 2021[update], Ports are available for x86-based and PowerPC-based personal computers (PCs) in native and hosted flavors, with other architectures in development. In a show of full circle development, AROS was also ported to the Motorola 68000 series (m68k) based Amiga 1200, and there is also an ARM port for the Raspberry Pi series.


AROS originally stood for Amiga Research Operating System, but to avoid any trademark issues with the Amiga name, it was changed to the recursive acronym AROS Research Operating System.


The mascot of AROS is an anthropomorphic cat named Kitty, created by Eric Schwartz and officially adopted by the AROS Team in December 2, 2002.


Used in the core AROS About and installer tools, it was also adopted by several AROS community sites and early distributions.


Other AROS identifiable symbols and logos are based around the cat shape, such as the Icaros logo, which is a stylised cat's eye, or AFA (Aros for Amiga).


The project, begun in 1995, has over the years become an almost ""feature complete"" implementation of AmigaOSÂ â  which, as of May 2017,[needs update] only lacks a few areas of functionality. This was achieved by the efforts of a small team of developers.


It can be installed on most IBM PC compatibles, and features native graphics drivers for video cards such as the GeForce range made by Nvidia. As of May 2007 USB keyboards and mice are also supported. AROS has been ported to the Sam440ep PowerPC board and a first test version for the Efika was released in 2009.


While the OS is still lacking in applications, a few have been ported, including E-UAE, an emulation program that allows m68k-native AmigaOS applications to run. Some AROS-specific applications have also been written. AROS has TCP/IP networking support, and has available an experimental version of AMosaic web browser, for test purposes, among other Internet-related applications. The Poseidon USB stack has been ported to AROS.


AROS is designed to be source-compatible with AmigaOS. On m68k Amiga hardware it is also binary-compatible, so binaries already compiled for AmigaOS 3 can be run on AROS. On x86 IA-32 32-bit platforms Janus-UAE, an enhanced E-UAE, integrates Amiga emulation directly into AROS to run AmigaOS m68k binaries nearly transparent to the user. As of AugustÂ 2011[update], original AmigaOS 3 operating system files are needed for the emulation.


The aim of AROS is to remain aloof of the legal and political spats that have plagued other AmigaOS implementations by being independent of hardware and of any central control. The de facto motto of AROS, ""No schedule and rocking"" both lampoons the infamous words ""On Schedule and Rockin"" from Amiga, Inc. CEO Bill McEwen, and declares a lack of the formal deadlines.


A workable AmigaOS Kickstart clone for the Motorola 68000 processor was released on March 31, 2011 as part of a programming bounty. The memory requirement is 2Â MB Chip RAM and 1Â MB Fast RAM. This software is a complete free open-source alternative to AmigaOS.


The main AROS system files can be downloaded in many flavors from the project website. These files are compiled straight from the SVN source tree at night time, and are available as nightly builds. Nightlies also include some third party applications to allow people using the system to perform some very basic tasks.


For final/average user, like Linux, there are several distributions available:


Since April 2009, the name VMWAros has been changed into ""Icaros Desktop"" to avoid ambiguities with any existing copyrighted Virtual Machine of any kind. Amiga 68K emulation integration, 3D acceleration for Nvidia cards and latest updates of applications can be found there. The latest version of Icaros Desktop is version 2.2.7 (released 9 April, 2019).


Broadway is a distribution of AROS begun late 2009. The goal has been to provide a simple and complete introduction to what AROS has to offer. Also added was commercial software like a media center, a cloud storage service, and an appstore. Last version is 1.0 preview 5, released April 16, 2016.


AspireOS is a distribution, begun in 2011, by Nikos Tomatsidis, which is focused on Dell Latitude D520 and Acer Aspire One 110, 150 computers. Latest version is 2.2, codenamed ""Obitus"", released November 2018.


AROS Vision is a native m68k distribution, which can run on both real hardware or in emulators like UAE.


ApolloOS is an active m68k distribution, crafted specially for the Vampire V4 Standalone FPGA-based system.


Haage & Partner used little parts of AROS source code for AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9.

26443180,Visa requirements for Venezuelan citizens,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Venezuelan_citizens,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visa_requirements_for_Venezuelan_citizens&action=info,"Visa requirements for Venezuelan citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Venezuela. As of 7 September 2021, Venezuelan citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 130 countries and territories, ranking the Venezuelan passport 43th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Colombia) according to the Henley Passport Index.


Venezuelans do not need to use a passport when traveling to Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, as they may use their ID card. Moreover, Venezuelans may also travel to the United States, Canada, Spain and several Latin American countries using expired passports.


Since 2017, 10 countries in Latin America and Caribbean (Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, Saint Lucia, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Caribbean Netherlands) have stopped providing visa-free access to Venezuelans following the ongoing refugee crisis and reinstated visa requirements for those seeking to enter these countries. Some countries will still allow Venezuelans to enter visa-free if holding a valid visa/residence permit from a particular third country, such as Canada or the United States.


Visa requirements for holders of normal passports traveling for tourist purposes:


Holding a Visa or Permanent Resident Permit duly issued by the United States of America, Commonwealth of Australia, Canada, Republic of Korea (South Korea), State of Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Republic of Singapore, or a Schengen Visa from any member state of the European Union, (i) granted for multiple entries and exits; (ii) that has been used at least once to enter the territory of the granting State; and (iii) with a validity of at least one (1) year, may enter the national territory without the requirement of a Stamped Visa (Executive Decree No. 521 6 August 2018, replacing Executive Decree No. 591 28 December 2016 and Executive Decree No. 114 4 April 2018). Transit visa is not required if connection time is under 12 hours.


Visa requirements for Venezuelan citizens for visits to various territories, disputed areas, partially recognized countries not mentioned in the list above, and restricted zones:





Many countries have entry restrictions on foreigners that go beyond the common requirement of having either a valid visa or a visa exemption. Such restrictions may be health related or impose additional documentation requirements on certain classes of people for diplomatic or political purposes.


Many countries require a minimum number of blank pages to be available in the passport being presented, typically one or two pages. Endorsement pages, which often appear after the visa pages, are not counted as being available.


Many African countries, including  Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic,  Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, CÃ´te d'Ivoire,  Gabon,   Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia,  Niger, Rwanda,  Sierra Leone and Togo,  require all incoming passengers older than nine months to one year to have a current International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, as does the South American territory of French Guiana.


Some other countries require vaccination only if the passenger is coming from an infected area or has visited one recently or has transited for 12 hours in those countries: Algeria, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.


An increasing number of countries have been imposing additional COVID-19 related health restrictions such as quarantine measures and testing requirements. Many countries increasingly consider the vaccination status of travellers with regard to quarantine requirements or when deciding to allow them entry at all. This is justified by research that shows that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine lasts for six months or so.


In the absence of specific bilateral agreements, countries requiring passports to be valid for at least 6 more months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Anguilla, Bahrain, Bhutan, Botswana, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, CuraÃ§ao, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru. Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, and Vietnam.


Countries requiring passports valid for at least 4 months on arrival include Micronesia and Zambia.


Countries requiring passports with a validity of at least 3 months beyond the date of intended departure include Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Nauru, Moldova and New Zealand. 
Similarly, the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, all European Union countries (except the Republic of Ireland) together with Switzerland also require 3 months validity beyond the date of the bearer's intended departure unless the bearer is an EEA or Swiss national.


Countries requiring passports valid for at least 3 months on arrival include Albania, Honduras, North Macedonia, Panama, and Senegal.


Bermuda requires passports to be valid for at least 45 days upon entry.


Countries that require a passport validity of at least one month beyond the date of intended departure include Eritrea, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macau, the Maldives and South Africa.


Other countries, such as Japan, Ireland and the United Kingdom, require a passport valid throughout the period of the intended stay. 


A very few countries, such as Paraguay, just require a passport valid on arrival. 


Some countries have bilateral agreements with other countries to shorten the period of passport validity required for each other's citizens or even accept passports that have already expired (but not been cancelled).


Some countries, including Australia, Canada, Fiji, New Zealand and the United States, routinely deny entry to non-citizens who have a criminal record while others impose restrictions depending on the type of conviction and the length of the sentence.


The government of a country can declare a diplomat persona non grata, banning their entry into that country. In non-diplomatic use, the authorities of a country may also declare a foreigner persona non grata permanently or temporarily, usually because of unlawful activity.


Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen do not allow entry to people with passport stamps from Israel or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa, or where there is evidence of previous travel to Israel such as entry or exit stamps from neighbouring border posts in transit countries such as Jordan and Egypt. 


To circumvent this Arab League boycott of Israel, the Israeli immigration services have now mostly ceased to stamp foreign nationals' passports on either entry to or exit from Israel (unless the entry is for some work-related purposes). Since 15 January 2013, Israel no longer stamps foreign passports at Ben Gurion Airport. Passports are still (as of 22Â JuneÂ 2017[update]) stamped at Erez when passing into and out of Gaza.[citation needed]


The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage claims that having an Israeli stamp does not disqualify someone from visiting Saudi Arabia.


Iran refuses admission to holders of passports containing an Israeli visa or stamp that is less than 12 months old.


Due to a state of war existing between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Armenian citizens and other foreign nationals of Armenian descent are likely to encounter difficulties when attempting to enter the Republic of Azerbaijan.


Azerbaijan bans visits by foreign citizens to the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh (the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh), its surrounding territories, and the Azerbaijani exclaves of Karki, YuxarÄ± Æskipara, BarxudarlÄ±, and Sofulu which are de jure part of Azerbaijan but under the control of Armenia, without the prior consent of the government of Azerbaijan. Foreign citizens who enter these territories will be permanently banned from entering the Republic of Azerbaijan and will be included in their ""list of personae non gratae"". As of 2Â SeptemberÂ 2019,[update] the list mentioned 852 people.


Several countries mandate that all travellers, or all foreign travellers, be fingerprinted on arrival and will refuse admission to or even arrest travellers who refuse to comply. In some countries, such as the United States, this may apply even to transit passengers who merely wish to quickly change planes rather than go landside.


Fingerprinting countries include Afghanistan, Argentina, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Japan, Kenya (both fingerprints and a photo are taken), Malaysia upon entry and departure, 
Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Uganda and the United States.


Many countries also require a photo be taken of people entering the country. The United States, which does not fully implement exit control formalities at its land frontiers (although long mandated by domestic legislation), intends to implement facial recognition for passengers departing from international airports to identify people who overstay their visa.


Together with fingerprint and face recognition, iris scanning is one of three biometric identification technologies internationally standardised since 2006 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for use in e-passports and the United Arab Emirates conducts iris scanning on visitors who need to apply for a visa.

He translated for Al-Mansur the major medical works of Galen and Hippocrates, and also translated Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos.


Translation was not a fully developed skill: al-Batriq worked by a combination of direct word-for-word translation and transliteration of ancient Greek words into Arabic where no equivalent was to be found.

6406136,Beijing Military Region,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Military_Region,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing_Military_Region&action=info,"The Beijing Military Region was one of seven military regions for the Chinese People's Liberation Army.  From the mid 1980s to 2017, it had administration of all military affairs within Beijing city, Tianjin city, Hebei province, Shanxi province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.  The Region is mainly responsible for defending the People's Republic of China from Mongolia and Russia, and also protects the capital of China, and had the largest number of military personnel of any of the seven regions active from 1985-2017. The Region has now been disbanded and superseded by the Central Theater Command.


Both the 63rd and 65th Corps/Group Armies were stationed in the Beijing area after returning from the Korean War and remained in the region ever since, becoming Group Armies after 1985. The 13th Air Force Corps was stationed at Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province from 1971 to 1976.


On 26 October 1988 the 17th Air Division was reorganized into the Beijing MR Training Base (serials 6xx2x).


In reductions announced in September 2003, the 24th Group Army (Hebei), and the 63rd Group Army (Shanxi) were both disbanded. About the same time, the 10th Air Corps, also stationed in the region, was disestablished (PLAAF 2010).


The International Institute for Strategic Studies attributed to the command 300,000 personnel in 2006, consisting of three group armies (the 27th Army, 38th Army, and the 65th Army), two armoured divisions, one mechanised infantry division, five motorised divisions, one artillery division, three armoured, seven motorised infantry, four artillery, a total of five various anti-aircraft brigades, and one anti-tank regiment. The command is also augmented by the Beijing Garrison, which consists of the 1st and 3rd Beijing Garrison Divisions (Military Police), and the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion and Color Guard Company, both of which are charged with public duties. The command is also home to the PLA Navy (PLAN) North Sea Fleet.


The last commander was General Song Puxuan (2014-2016). The political commissar was General Liu Fulian.


The Beijing Military Region traces its lineage to the establishment of the Northwest Military Region in May 1948. It was renamed the Beijing Military Region in 1955, when the Inner Mongolia Military Region was downgraded to a district, and was folded into the Beijing Military Region.


The Beijing Military Region is primarily charged with protecting the capital. Because of its location in the capital, the Beijing Military Region was the most important of the seven military regions. Each unit from the Beijing Military Region contributed forces to Beijing for the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and these elements remained deployed in Beijing long after using deadly force to remove the demonstrators.


In addition to guarding the capital, the Beijing Military Region is also in charge of training key personnel for leadership positions through the numerous military academies in the region.


The organizational structure as of 2016 was as follows:


Organizations affiliated with the Beijing Military Region often use the nickname ""comrade"" (Chinese: æå; pinyin: zhÃ nyÇu; lit. 'battle friend'), including the Comrade Performance Troupe (Chinese: æåæå·¥å¢) and the Comrade Newspaper (Chinese: æåæ¥).",6,12 August 2006, 6 December 2020,114,0,0

It was discovered on 4 June 1992, by American astronomer couple Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was named after Cadmus from Greek mythology.


Cadmus orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 0.8â4.3Â AU once every 4.04 years (1,474 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.70 and an inclination of 18Â° with respect to the ecliptic. It is a member of the Alinda group of asteroids with a 3:1 resonance with Jupiter that has excited the eccentricity of the orbit over the eons.


Due to a precovery obtained at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory, the body's observation arc already begins in 1980.


It has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.0972Â AU (14,500,000Â km), which corresponds to 37.9 lunar distances.  On 7 December 2056, it will pass at 0.241Â AU (36,100,000Â km) from Earth.


As of 2016, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown. Based on an absolute magnitude of 15.1, it measures between 3 and 6 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since near-Earth asteroids are often of a silicaceous rather than of a carbonaceous composition, with higher albedos, typically above 0.20, the asteroid's diameter might be on the lower end of NASA's published conversion table, as the higher the body's reflectivity (albedo), the smaller its diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness).


This minor planet is named for Cadmus, the Phoenician prince, first king of Theben, and one of the greatest heroes before the days of Heracles. The minor planets 1873 Agenor, 52 Europa, 5731 Zeus, 881 Athene, 40 Harmonia and 1388 Aphrodite are named after related figures from Greek mythology.",0,7 December 2007, 29 June 2021,70,0,0

Trevor A. Dixon, a sculptor with Hinchcliffe Miniatures, left in 1976 to form his own company, Dixon Miniatures. His first products were 54Â mm miniatures for use with Napoleonic wargames. The company then started producing 28Â mm figures, including a line of Mongols and historical Japanese figures such as samurai, ashigaru, and ninja.


With the appearance in the late 1970s of role-playing games with historical oriental settings such as Bushido, several reviewers noted that Dixon's line of Japanese figures would work well in these games.


In 1979, Dixon began to produce 25Â mm miniatures specifically for role-playing games, including a line of dwarves. Over the next forty years they continued to create new lines to cover many historical periods including Vikings, the Old West, and gangsters of the American Prohibition era.


In the August 1979 edition of Dragon (Issue 28), Phil Neuscheler noted that Dixon's Japanese figures, distributed in North America by Heritage Models, could be used for fantasy play. Three issues later, Neuscheler again recommended Dixon 25Â mm miniatures for use with fantasy role-playing games.


In the August 1983 edition of Imagine, Mike Brunton described the figures as ""rather thick-set but cleanly cast and well detailed."" He liked the fact that the miniatures came with a variety of weapons, ""giving the modeller a good deal of freedom in choosing what the finished product looks like."" He concluded, ""Although these figures may not seem to be directly relevant to RPG players, they are worth looking at for anyone interested in Bushido or something similar, or someone looking for a fighter with a difference.""


Mike Brunton reviewed Dixon's Legends of Nippon series of figures for Imagine magazine, and stated that ""Overall: recommended, especially if you are looking for something a bit different.""

Similar to a hot dog, but usually larger, spicier, and with more coarsely-ground meat, the sausage is often half-pork and half-beef, smoked, and served with herbs, onion, and chili sauce.


The etymology of ""half-smoke"" possibly comes from the original half-pork, half-beef composition, the ingredients and smoked method of preparation. Another possible explanation is that the texture and flavor is halfway between smoked sausage and a regular hot dog. Yet another explanation is that it refers to cooks cutting the sausage in half when grilling. Composition of the sausages varies by brand and some brands even make more than one kind. A half-smoke can be half pork, half beef, all beef, or anything in between. It can be steamed instead of smoked. The company thought to be the originator of the sausage, Briggs & Company, was sold by its owner, Raymond Briggs, in 1950 without clarifying the origin of the name. The products sold under the name generally have a genuine or artificial smoke flavoring and coarser texture than a regular hot dog; these are the key features that distinguish them.


The ""original"" half-smoke is considered to be the sausage distributed by D.C.'s Briggs and Co. meatpackers, originating in around 1950, though Raymond Briggs started selling his half-smokes in about 1930. Eventually, Briggs was sold to another meat distributor, where, by some accounts, the quality of the meat declined.


Numerous hot dog carts in Washington, D.C., sell steamed half-smokes, with those on Constitution Avenue catering to tourists and those on Pennsylvania Avenue and many other hot dog carts throughout the downtown area serving federal employees. Half-smokes are the ""official dog"" of the Washington Nationals. The most prominent location is often cited as Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington's U Street neighborhood, which has long been a center of Black Washington, and was an essential stop for President-elect Barack Obama in 2009.


Another popular location for half-smokes is the Weenie Beenie in South Arlington, Virginia, located near the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park trail. Founded in 1950, it pre-dates Ben's Chili Bowl. Among newer purveyors is Meats & Foods, on Florida Avenue just east of Ben's Chili Bowl, which makes its own handmade version of the sausage.",3,23 July 2006, 16 September 2021,135,1,1
26184631,Hein Wellens,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hein_Wellens,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hein_Wellens&action=info,"Henrick Joan Joost (Hein J. J. ) Wellens, M.D., (1935â2020) was a Dutch cardiologist who is considered one of the founding fathers of the cardiology subspecialty known as clinical cardiac electrophysiology. Clinical cardiac electrophysiology enables patients with cardiac arrhythmias to be subjected to catheter electrode mapping and stimulation studies.


Wellens was known among European cardiologists as ""the giant of Maastricht"" and for many years was associated with the University of Limburg School of Medicine in Maastricht, Netherlands. At his department of cardiology, many future clinical cardiac electrophysiologists trained from 1976 until his retirement in 2002.


Wellens, MD was born on 13 November 1935 in The Hague in the Netherlands. He studied medicine at the University of Leiden. Following two years of internal medicine, he did three years of cardiology in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis Hospital of the University of Amsterdam under the guidance of Prof Dirk Durrer.


In the late sixties, at the University Hospital of Amsterdam, he investigated patients with cardiac arrhythmias by placing cardiac catheters allowing the recording of the electrical activation of the heart at different sites. By connecting these catheters to a pacing device, he showed that it was possible to initiate and terminate cardiac arrhythmias, localize the site of origin of the arrhythmia, discover the mechanism. By using this approach (called programmed electrical stimulation) Wellens not only unraveled mechanisms and localization of arrhythmias in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome but also other types of supraventricular tachycardias.


In the early seventies, he showed that programmed electrical stimulation of the heart could also be used to study the mechanism and localization of ventricular tachycardia. In 1971 he published the first book on programmed stimulation of the heart in patients with tachycardias. In 1973 Wellens was appointed Professor of Cardiology at the University of Amsterdam. At that time his new approach allowed the investigation of the effect of drugs on the tachycardia mechanism, the development of new therapeutic strategies such as the termination of tachycardias by specially designed pacemakers, the surgical removal or isolation of the tachycardia substrate, and ultimately cure of cardiac arrhythmias by catheter ablation.


In 1971, he reported on the use of programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in patients with atrial flutter, AV nodal tachycardia, and accessory atrioventricular connections. In 1972, he showed that the arrhythmia of patients with ventricular tachycardia could also reproducibly be initiated and terminated by timed premature stimuli. These investigations were the basis for the new surgical and pacing approaches to the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias that became known as ""cardiac electrophysiology"".


Wellens left Amsterdam in 1977 to become Professor and Chairman of the Department of Cardiology at the Academic Hospital of the new Maastricht University. There he created his school of arrhythmology, educating in the period 1977-2001 many cardiologists from all over the world. After returning to their home country, many became leaders in cardiology.


Wellens was a student Professor Dirk Durrer in Amsterdam, Netherlands and participated in the early development of programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In these patients, cardiac arrhythmias were shown to be initiated and terminated by critically timed premature beats.


Wellens also demonstrated that the reproducible initiation and termination of arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart allowed the study of the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on the mechanism of the arrhythmia. In 1977, he moved to the new University of Limburg in Maastricht, Netherlands, to develop academic cardiology there. He created an internationally known center for the study and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.


In 1990 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.


Wellens directed the Interuniversity Cardiological Institute of the Netherlands (ICIN) from 1993 to 2003, an Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in which the Dutch research activities in cardiovascular research are combined at the national level. He wrote or co-authored over 670 peer-reviewed articles, 254 chapters in books, and was the author or editor of 21 books on cardiology. In collaboration with Prof Mark Josephson from United States, he taught advanced ECG and electrophysiology concepts at international Wellens and Josephson Advanced ECG course.

He was regarded as a pioneer in the development of the writing of the Luganda language, and held prominent positions in the Ugandan colonial government of the day. He also worked as a leading educational evaluation theorist for programmes in the developing world. Chesswas was awarded an MBE in the 1965 New Year Honours.


Chesswas was born in 1919. He served in Indian Army Pioneer Corps during World War II and was promoted from a private soldier to 2nd lieutenant in January 1941. He died in Wiltshire, England in February 2009.


Chesswas was the author of ""The Essentials of Luganda"" (1954); the third (1963) and fourth (1967) editions of which are commonly used as a textbook for courses in Luganda language.


Chesswas was employed by the Luganda Language Board as a teacher of Luganda when, in 1949, the Government for the Uganda Protectorate began to offer free courses in Luganda to any officer wishing to take up the study.  Recognising the lack of teachers in the language, Chesswas took the opportunity to publish a textbook for stations where no teachers of the language were available.  Chesswas cites Sir Apolo Kagwa's Engero zâAbaganda and Michael B. Nsimbi's Olulimi Olugand as his major sources, and acknowledges Nsimbi as his primary aid in developing the text.

31154813,Pati Kremer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pati_Kremer,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pati_Kremer&action=info,"Pati Kremer (1867â1943) was a Russian revolutionary socialist and pioneer of the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Bund). She was the wife of Arkadi Kremer.


Pati Kremer was born Matla Srednicki on 2 January 1867 in Vilna. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. In the 1880s she moved to St. Petersburg to study dentistry and there became involved with revolutionary political circles. She was also active in educational and literacy projects for workers. In 1889 she was arrested for the first time. Upon her release, she returned to Vilna, where she became a leading member and organizer of the Jewish Social-Democratic circle known as the 'Vilna Group', together with John Mill (1870â1952) and Arkadi Kremer (1865â1935). Pati and Arkadi were subsequently married.


The Vilna Group was one of the precursors of the Bund and of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP). Pati Kremer was arrested again in September 1897 and banished to Mogilev. There she resumed her activities on behalf of the Bund, working with other political exiles and local workers. In 1898 she secretly attended the second congress of the Bund in Kovno. In 1902, she and Arkadi (who had been arrested in 1898) escaped abroad, making their way to Britain, the USA, Switzerland and France. They mostly remained in France until 1921, becoming French citizens and working with the French Socialist Party as well as the Bund.


In 1921, the Kremers returned to Vilna, where Arkadi became chairman of the local branch of the Bund. Pati Kremer worked as editor and translator in the publishing house of Boris Kletskin (1875â1937), a Bundist. In 1935, her husband died, and she began work on a commemorative volume eventually published in New York in 1942. During the German occupation of Vilna in the Second World War she became a leading figure in the city's Jewish ghetto, organizing and maintaining secret Yiddish libraries and clandestine meetings of the Bund. When the Ghetto was razed by the Germans in September 1943, Pati Kremer as among the many victims who were rounded up, transported to the Sobibor extermination camp and killed.

53160772,Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Flight_into_Egypt_(Bruegel),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Landscape_with_the_Flight_into_Egypt_(Bruegel)&action=info,"Landscape with the Flight into Egypt is a 1563 oil on wooden board painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, showing the biblical Flight into Egypt of Mary and Joseph with the infant Jesus.  It measures 37.1 by 55.6 centimetres (14.6Â in ÃÂ 21.9Â in) and is displayed at the Courtauld Gallery in London.


The work is a naturalistic world landscape, following the conventions established by Joachim Patinir.  The ostensible subject, the Holy Family, are small figures in an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint, with mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  The subject had long been a popular one in Early Netherlandish art, and increasingly so since Patinir.


Joseph is leading a donkey, bearing Mary who is holding the infant Jesus, tightly wrapped for the journey; his white head can be seen on her chest.  They are descending a slope overlooking an Alpine landscape, with a wide river valley bordered by hills and mountains.  The painting is dominated by tones of brown and green for the land, and the blue of the water and sky.  Mary's unusual red cloak (rather than her traditional blue) and white headgear makes her stand out against the blue of the river, while Joseph's greyish clothes contrast with the green and brown background of wooded hills.  In the background, the buildings of towns are faintly visible on each side of the river.


On the tree stump to the right, a pagan statue has fallen out of its shrine as the family passed by, symbolising the triumph of Christ over paganism.  This was one of a number of miraculous incidents that medieval legend had added to the very brief biblical story. A branch fallen against a tree creates a cross, presaging the crucifixion.  Two tiny salamanders, symbols of evil, can be seen below the figures (very near the bottom edge).


The painting is signed ""BRVEGEL MDLXIII"".  It was owned by Brueghel's patron Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (1517â1586), an important administrator in the Habsburg Netherlands.  The painting is mentioned in an inventory of 1607; it is the only painting which can be certainly identified as belonging to him.  It was later owned by the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who owned ten or eleven other Bruegels.  It was not well known when it was auctioned at Christie's in London in 1939, and bought by Count Antoine Seilern.  Together with the other Bruegel in the collection, Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, it was donated to the Courtauld Institute of Art in the Princes Gate bequest in 1978.",1,12 February 2017, 1 September 2021,45,1,1

The son of a musical father and a pupil of the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm, he studied piano, but mastered the oboe and violin as well.  In 1856â57 he studied counterpoint at the Leipzig Conservatory with Ernst Richter; there, in a musical culture that bore the imprint of Mendelssohn, he became familiar with the music of Robert Schumann and also with that of Richard Wagner. On his return to Stockholm he worked as a theatre conductor, and at the Royal Swedish Opera as choirmaster and eventually assistant conductor.


He wrote several operettas (The Devilâs First Try, 1856) and incidental music for about 80 plays, such as a Swedish translation of Schiller's Die Jungfrau von Orleans (""The Maid of Orleans""). His influence can be detected in the music of later Swedish Romantic composers, Hugo AlfvÃ©n and Wilhelm Peterson-Berger.


SÃ¶derman died aged 43. His music is virtually unknown outside Sweden.

5608888,Actia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actia,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Actia&action=info,"In Ancient Roman religious tradition, Actia (Greek: á¼ÎºÏÎ¹Î±) was  a festival of Apollo, celebrated at Nicopolis in Epirus, with wrestling, musical contests, horse racing, and sea battles. It was reestablished by Augustus, in commemoration of his victory over Mark Antony off Actium in 31 BC; that it was probably the revival of an ancient festival is suggested by the celebrated temple of Apollo at Actium, which is mentioned by Thucydides, and Strabo, and which was enlarged by Augustus. The games instituted by Augustus were celebrated every five years (ÏÎµÎ½ÏÎ±ÎµÏÎ·ÏÎ¯Ï, ludi quinquennales); they received the title of a sacred agon and were also called Olympia.


This ancient stadium was located in the so-called 'Proasteion' (sacred grove) of the Graeco-Roman city of Nikopolis. Together with the nearby gymnasion, theatre and hippodrome it was the location of the famous Actian Games. These games, which featured athletic, equestrian and musical events, were first held in 27 BCE to celebrate the victory of the first Roman emperor Augustus over his adversaries, Marc Antony and his Egyptian wife Cleopatra. They were held every four years up to the mid-3rd century CE.


Dating from just after the city's foundation, the ancient stadium of Nikopolis has two semicircular ends (sphendones), typical of the amphitheatre type that was in use during the first 200 years of the principate. The stadiums of ancient Laodikeia (near Pamukkale, Turkey) and Aphrodisias (Geyre, Turkey) have a similar architecture.


The north side of the stadium, which must have held a capacity of at least 10,000 spectators, was built on the side of a hill, while artificial deposits were used for the other sides. The walls were made of a rubble core faced with several courses of bricks. On the west side of the stadium were three apsidal entrances leading to the gymnasion, the central one larger than the others. The entrances in the sphendone at the east led to the theatre nearby. On the sphendone at the south side there were residential rooms and facilities for athletes and spectators (inns, shops, lodgings etc.)


Locals call this stadium to karavi, meaning 'the ship', which of course relates to the structure's shape. Archaeological investigations are still regularly undertaken in and around the stadium today.",1,18 June 2006, 9 April 2021,38,0,0
13322638,Jorge Jesus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Jesus,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Jesus&action=info,"Jorge Fernando Pinheiro de Jesus ComIH (Portuguese pronunciation:Â [ËÊÉÉ¾Ê ÊÉ¨ËzuÊ]; born 24 July 1954) is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who is the manager of Benfica.


He started his career with Sporting CP, going on to play for 12 other clubs in 17 years as a professional, which included nine Primeira Liga seasons.


Jesus began a coaching career in 1990, and his first stop in the main category was with Felgueiras in the 1995â96 campaign. He went on to work with several teams, arriving at Benfica in 2009 and winning ten trophies (a club record for a single manager) as well as reaching two UEFA Europa League finals with them. He became manager of Flamengo in 2019 and won the Copa Libertadores and Campeonato Brasileiro SÃ©rie A in his first year.


He was twice considered one of the 10 best club coaches in the world by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, in 2013 (8th place) and in 2019 (7th place).


Jesus, son of Virgolino AntÃ³nio de Jesus who played for Sporting CP in the 1940s, was born in Amadora, Lisbon, and finished his football formation with the same club, making his top flight debut with S.C. Olhanense on loan from the Lions.


He played with Sporting's first team in the 1975â76 season, appearing in 12 matches and starting once as the Lisbon club finished in fifth place. Subsequently, released, he played in the country's top flight in seven of the following eight years, representing C.F. Os Belenenses, Grupo Desportivo Riopele, Juventude de Ãvora, UniÃ£o de Leiria, VitÃ³ria de SetÃºbal and S.C. Farense, amassing totals in the category of 166 games and 14 goals.


Jesus retired in 1990 at the age of 36, after spells in the second (mainly with his hometown C.F. Estrela da Amadora) and third levels.


After starting as a manager with lowly Amora FC, Jesus moved in December 1993 to F.C. Felgueiras as a replacement for Rodolfo Reis, helping the club promote to the top flight in his second season and being in and out of the team until January 1998, with Felgueiras back in division two.


Subsequently, he led former team Estrela da Amadora to two consecutive eighth-place finishes in the first division and, in quick succession, managed both VitÃ³ria de SetÃºbal and Amadora, celebrating top flight promotions with both even though he was fired by the latter in March 2003. In 2003â04 he helped VitÃ³ria de GuimarÃ£es narrowly avoid relegation, finishing two points ahead of first relegated team F.C. Alverca.


In the following four years, always in division one, Jesus was in charge of Moreirense FC (suffering relegation), UniÃ£o de Leiria and Belenenses, finishing fifth with the latter and qualifying to the UEFA Cup, and adding a presence in the 2007 Portuguese Cup final, losing 0â1 to Sporting.


On 20 May 2008, one day after leaving Belenenses, Jesus took over at S.C. Braga, leading the Minho side to the fifth position in the league and the round-of-16 in the UEFA Cup. Highlights in the latter competition included a 3â0 home win against Portsmouth and a last-minute 0â1 defeat to A.C. Milan at the San Siro. He won the last edition of the UEFA Intertoto Cup, something never achieved by other Portuguese club.


On 17 June 2009, Jesus replaced Quique Flores at the helm of S.L. Benfica. In his first year he led Benfica to the first division title after a five-year wait, with only two league defeats and 78 goals scored, also reaching the quarter-finals in the Europa League, losing to Liverpool on a 3â5 aggregate score (this would be the last match Benfica would lose in a run that lasted 27 games); he quickly implemented a 4â1â3â2 formation which resulted in highly attractive football.


On 5 October 2009 Jesus achieved his 100th victory in the Portuguese League, in a 3â1 home win against F.C. PaÃ§os de Ferreira. The following month he experienced his first Derby de Lisboa, which ended in a 0â0 away draw; at the end of the victorious campaign, which also brought the domestic League Cup, the coach was rewarded with a new contract extension, running until 2013.


After a 2â0 win at VfB Stuttgart in that season's Europa League (4â1 on aggregate), Benfica's first ever victory in Germany, Jesus surpassed the record held by Jimmy Hagan's 1972â73 team, with 16 consecutive wins. During the league campaign, which started without departed Ãngel Di MarÃ­a and Ramires, the lack of rotation caused[citation needed] a major fatigue in the most used players. At the end of the season, Benfica only won the League Cup despite setting a domestic record of 18 consecutive wins in all competitions.


In the 2011â12 season, Jesus guided Benfica to the second place in the league. He led the team to a club's fourth League Cup, and to the knockout rounds of the 2011â12 Champions League, defeating FC Zenit Saint Petersburg first, before losing to Chelsea, in the quarter-finals.


On 10 December 2012, after a 3â1 away victory against Sporting, Jesus became the most successful Portuguese coach in the capital derby with seven wins in a total of nine, surpassing Toni (6/10). On 26 January of the following year he defeated former side Braga at the EstÃ¡dio Municipal de Braga for the first time, after three defeats and one draw. He briefly led the league with a five-point advantage but did not maintain it, finishing in the second place again.


On 15 March 2013, in a match against FC Girondins de Bordeaux in the campaign's Europa League, Jesus reached the 200 game-milestone with Benfica, becoming the sixth coach in the club's history to do so. During the season he led the club to its first European final in 23 years: after coming third in its group in the UEFA Champions League, the side reached the final of the Europa League, losing 1â2 to Champions League winners Chelsea. Domestically, Benfica finished second in the league despite leading up to second to last day, and reached the final of the Portuguese Cup, their first since 2004â05, suffering an unexpected defeat at the hands of GuimarÃ£es; these losses added great pressure on the coach, as the club ended the season trophyless for the first time since 2007â08.


On 4 June 2013, Jesus renewed his contract for a further two seasons. When police attempted to clear Benfica supporters from the pitch at the end of a match at GuimarÃ£es in September, he became physically involved, taking the side of supporters while obstructing the police. The Portuguese Football Federation gave him a 30-day suspension, which meant he would miss four league matches, and fined him â¬5,355. On 11 February 2014, Jesus won his tenth game (2â0) against Sporting, which draw two and won only one as an opposing coach. On 20 March, he surpassed John Mortimore's 1985â86 record of 918 minutes without conceding a goal at home matches.


Jesus led Benfica to its 33rd title on 20 April 2014, and became the second Portuguese coach to win two national championships for the club after Toni. Four days earlier the team had beat FC Porto 3â1 in spite of being reduced to ten men with 1 hour left to play, thus reaching the final of the Portuguese Cup for the second consecutive time. On 28 April 2014, Jesus managed to put Benfica in another final, that of the domestic League Cup, eliminating Porto at the DragÃ£o on penalties in spite of being reduced to ten men with 1 hour left to play again. The trophy was won at Leiria on 7 May against Rio Ave FC, securing his fourth in the competition and the club's fifth. On 1 May 2014, Jesus helped the club progress to its second consecutive Europa League final, by defeating Juventus 2â1 on aggregate after a goalless draw in Turin. The Portuguese lost on penalties 13 days later in the same city to Sevilla FC and he stated that referee Felix Brych overlooked three penalty decisions for Benfica. On 18 May 2014, after seeing out Rio Ave in the Portuguese Cup final, Jesus became the first Portuguese coach and the seventh overall to win the double for Benfica (the tenth in the club's history). He also became the first coach in Portugal to conquer the domestic treble in one season (the club's first ever).


On 10 August 2014, Jesus won his first SupertaÃ§a, as he surpassed JÃ¡nos Biri as the coach with most matches at Benfica (273) and also tied with Cosme DamiÃ£o in number of trophies won (8), surpassing both JÃ¡nos Biri and Otto GlÃ³ria. With that victory, he became the first coach to win Primeira Liga, TaÃ§a de Portugal, SupertaÃ§a CÃ¢ndido de Oliveira and TaÃ§a da Liga (furthermore, in a year). He continued to break club records, becoming the coach with most victories (195) on 27 September 2014, in a win against Estoril. On 18 January 2015, Jesus reached the 300th game milestone at Benfica, with the highest winning percentage since Jimmy Hagan in the early 1970s, and on 26 April he surpassed Otto GlÃ³ria as the coach with the most league matches at Benfica. On 17 May 2015, Jesus guided the club to its second consecutive league title, making it the first time Benfica won back-to-back league titles since 1984 (31 years), after Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson, and became the first Portuguese coach to win two consecutive league titles at Benfica. On 29 May 2015, he won his fifth TaÃ§a da Liga (the club's sixth), and became the Benfica coach with most titles won (10) and the only to win 3 titles in two consecutive seasons. On 4 June 2015, Benfica announced they had concluded negotiations on a possible renewal of contract with Jesus, whose contract ended on 30 June.


On 5 June 2015, Jesus signed a three-year contract with Benfica's Lisbon rivals Sporting CP, starting his functions on 1 July and earning â¬5 million per year. His first official match as Sporting coach was a Derby de Lisboa encounter with Benfica in the 2015 SupertaÃ§a, which Sporting won 1â0. Despite a positive start, he then failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and did not win any other trophy, finishing second in the Primeira Liga with 86 points (a club record), two points behind Benfica.


In May 2016, Jesus renewed his contract with Sporting and started earning â¬6 million a year until 2019. However, the 2016â17 season was trophyless.


In the following season, on 15 May 2018, Jesus, along with assistant coach Raul JosÃ© and several players, was injured following an attack by around 50 supporters of Sporting at the club's training ground after the team finished third in the league and missed out on the UEFA Champions League qualification. Five days later, Sporting lost the Portuguese Cup final to Aves, making Jesus the first manager to have lost in the final with three different clubs.


On 5 June 2018, Jesus left Portugal for the first time in his career and took charge of Saudi incumbent national champions Al-Hilal. In his first game on 17 August, he won the Saudi Super Cup with a 2â1 victory over Al-Ittihad in London. Although he had a record of sixteen wins and only one defeat in twenty matches, he was sacked by the chairman on 26 January 2019 following contractual disagreements.


On 1 June 2019, Jesus was appointed manager of Brazilian club Flamengo for a year. Upon signing, he was met with a negative reaction by fans, former Flamengo players and commentators, who believed that he was too old and could not adapt to Brazilian football; when the team beat opponents, their managers would credit the results to Flamengo's players and finances rather than to Jesus. He reacted to this atmosphere by saying ""I did not come to take anybody's place or to teach anyone. I am neither better nor worse, I work according to a methodology. I would like to remind my Brazilian colleagues that we had a Brazilian [manager] in the national team, Scolari. He was admired by the Portuguese managers. He and many others who worked in Portugal...All of us in Portugal tried to learn from them, there was never this verbal aggression that there is against me. I don't understand these closed minds, even from some who are now at home, wearing gloves and shaking"".


In his first game on 10 July, the team drew 1â1 at Athletico Paranaense in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Copa do Brasil. Four days later in his first Campeonato Brasileiro SÃ©rie A game, he beat GoiÃ¡s 6â1 at the MaracanÃ£ Stadium.


Jesus' Flamengo won the 2019 Copa Libertadores, defeating Argentina's River Plate 2â1 with a late comeback in the final in Lima, Peru, on 23 November. He was the first foreign manager to win any international trophy with a Brazilian team, the fifth to win the Copa Libertadores with a foreign club, and the second European coach, as well as the second non-South American native, to accomplish the feat, after then-Yugoslav Mirko JoziÄ with Chile's Colo-Colo in 1991; he was also the fourth Portuguese to become club continental champion, following Artur Jorge, Manuel JosÃ©, and JosÃ© Mourinho. Within 24 hours of winning the continental title, Flamengo also won the national championship, when then second-placed Palmeiras lost 2â1 to GrÃªmio. He was the second foreign manager, and the first non-South American, to win the Brazilian championship after Argentine Carlos Volante in the debut edition in 1959, the first foreign manager to win it since the round-robin format was introduced, the first manager from his country to win a league title in South America, and the third Portuguese to win a national championship in the Americas, after Guilherme Farinha and Pedro Caixinha.


On 30 December 2019, President of Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa awarded to Jesus the Order of Prince Henry commander medal (ComIH). He said that Jesus' achievements aided Portugal's reputation abroad.


On 17 July 2020, Jesus left Flamengo. He won five trophies with the Brazilian club, winning 43 of the 57 games in charge of the Rubro-Negro.


Jesus returned to Benfica on 3 August 2020, signing a two-year contract with the club. Despite a â¬105Â million investment, the biggest ever in Portuguese football, the season started with Benfica's elimination in the Champions League third qualifying round and continued with a loss at the Super Cup, an elimination from the League Cup, and a fourth place at the end of the league's first round. With his fourth loss at the Portuguese Cup final, Jesus equalled the record of JosÃ© Maria Pedroto and Fernando Vaz.


Jesus married his second wife, Ivone, and the couple had a son, Mauro. From his previous marriage, he had a daughter TÃ¢nia and a son GonÃ§alo.


He had over â¬1 million invested in the Banco Privado PortuguÃªs (BPP) when it went bankrupt in 2009. He recovered eighty percent of that amount in March 2014.


In March 2020, Jesus tested positive for COVID-19 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. He had previously requested that Brazilian football shut down due to the virus.

It was the 67th annual edition of the tournament.


This was the first edition of the tournament to not be available free-to-air at all, as the syndicated ACC package was shut down in favor of the launch of the cable-only ACCN, which exclusively carried the first round of the tournament, with the ESPN networks carrying the remainder of the tournament.


Due to ongoing concerns with the COVID-19 pandemic, officials announced that, initially, the tournament would only be played in front of essential tournament personnel, limited school administrators and student-athlete guests, broadcast television, and credentialed media members present, starting with the quarterfinals; however, shortly before the tipoff of the quarterfinal matchup between Florida State and Clemson, the ACC announced the tournament was canceled and Florida State, the regular season champions, would receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, though that decision became moot with the NCAA Tournament's cancellation later the same day.


Fourteen of the 15 ACC teams would have participated in the tournament; the other team, Georgia Tech, was banned from postseason play, including the conference tournament, due to NCAA rules violations. Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records. The top four seeds received double byes, while seeds 5 through 10 received single byes. Ultimately, the tournament being canceled shortly before the quarterfinal games were to have begun resulted in the top four seeds not playing at all.

Johnny Seven O.M.A. was the best selling boys' toy of 1964, and was marketed heavily on children's television. It has a unique number of features, including seven different actions (thus the ""Seven"" in the name). The toy is no longer made, and has become a collector's item.


All of the firing mechanisms are attached to the main rifle assembly, the pistol inserts from the bottom to provide the rifle grip (the pistol also holds caps for authentic firing sounds). The ""Rifle"" function shot twelve white bullets one at a time via a bolt action spring mechanism through the silver barrel. Three different ""rockets"" (The green Armour Piercing shell, Anti Bunker and the red Anti Tank fired via spring action on the main barrel. The Grenade Launcher was on top of the gun.


Johnny Seven also featured a bipod that provided stability for the various rockets and grenade. The stock could be removed to shorten the weapon while in the ""Tommy Gun"" mode. The toy when fully assembled was over three feet long, and weighed about four pounds.


A grenade launcher is located on top of the main body, above the pistol grip. The launcher extends upwards, and the spring loaded grenade is launched by depressing a button on the side of the rifle.


The red ""Armour Piercing"" missile is fired from a launcher located on the right of the body of the gun. The firing button is placed underneath the launcher.


The two large green shells were fired from the front of the rifle directly above the Rifle barrel. The firing button is on the left side of the rifle.


Twelve white bullets are fired from a fixed magazine on the rifle. The bullets are fed into the chamber by a spring-loaded bolt, one at a time.


Pull the lever back towards the stock, press the release button and you get a ""rat-a-tat"" machine gun noise.


The cap firing pistol could be removed from the gun.


To replace lost components, Topper also marketed an additional spare ammunition pack that comprised a complete set of four grenade/missiles and twelve bullets. Additional toy accessories were marketed under the ""Johnny Seven"" banner including a helmet and walkie-talkies. Deluxe Reading used the Topper Toys brand to add a modern flair to their new product lines.


Deluxe Reading was famous for creating huge package playsets that could be seen by children when viewing the top, unusable shelf in grocery store chains. By creating large, colorful boxes, the space could be used to market to the children that always accompanied parents while food shopping, an unusual marketing ""trick"" that worked well for Deluxe Reading and later copycat toy companies, such as Remco.


The ""Johnny Seven"" box came in two variations, one a standard box showing a boy looking through the sights of the gun, and the second (rare now for collectors) showed a ""battle field"" scenario behind the mounted gun with a see through plastic lid. The Johnny Seven gun was manufactured in four countries, and in order of rarity for collectors purposes, they were Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada (in a dual-language box) and the American version.


Deluxe Reading produced many memorable toys including the Johnny Lightning cars (similar to Mattel's Hot Wheels), the Crime Buster Gun (similar to the O.M.A, only geared towards kids play-acting cops and robbers), the Operation X 500 Space Base and others.

File selection criteria include name and last modified date.  The command specifier supports some special syntax options.  It can be used directly on the command-line, or in batch files or other scripts.


The forfiles command was originally provided as an add-on, in the Windows 98, Windows NT[citation needed] and Windows 2000 Resource Kits.  It became a standard utility with Windows Vista, as part of the new management features.


The forfiles command has several command-line switches.  If no switches or parameters given, it outputs the name of every file in the current directory.


This option treats glob patterns *.* and * differently.  The former will only match files with a dot in their name, while the latter will match even those with no dot or extension.  Most DOS/Windows commands will match files with no extension even when given a *.* pattern.


The command string is executed as given, except as noted below.


Sequences of the form 0xFF, where ""0x"" is literal, and ""FF"" represents any two-digit hexadecimal number, are replaced with the corresponding single-byte value.  This can be used to embed non-printing ASCII characters, or extended ASCII characters.


The sequence \"" is replaced with a literal quotation mark "".  Using the 0x sequence form described previously, 0x22 can also be used, which additionally hides the "" from the command interpreter.


Several variables are provided, to be used in the command as placeholders for the values from each file.  Variables are technically not required, but must be used if the command is to vary for each file.


The date switch (/D) selects files based on their last modified date, given a date argument.


The date argument can be given as a literal date, in MM/DD/YYYY format (other date formats are not accepted).  Alternatively, the date argument can be given as a number, in which case it is taken to mean an age in days (i.e., the day date days before the present date).


If the date argument begins with a minus (-), only files modified on or before the given date are selected (older file / modified earlier).  Otherwise, only files modified on or after the given date are selected (younger files / modified later).  An explicit plus (+) may be given, but is the default.  Note that both modes select files on the given date.  There is no way to select files only on a given date (without also either before or after).


The following command selects all log files (*.LOG) in the Windows directory 30 days or older, and lists them with their date.


The following command would delete the same files.

The difficulty in producing lab cultures may be linked to low growth rates and other limiting growth factors.


Methylomirabilis oxyfera, a member of the NC10 phylum, is the first organism discovered to couple methane oxidation to the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen (N2).  This is significant for several reasons. First, there are only three other biological pathways known to produce oxygen (photosynthesis, chlorate respiration, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species). Second, anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO) coupled to nitrite reduction links the global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and thus denitrifying methanotrophs in the NC10 phylum may influence methane content in the atmosphere. Third, this finding opens the possibility that oxygen was available in the atmosphere prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the Great Oxidation Event, which challenges certain aspects of modern theories regarding the evolution of early life on Earth.


The NC10 phylum was first proposed in 2003 on the basis of highly divergent 16S rRNA gene sequences from aquatic microbial formations in flooded caves (Nullarbor caves, Australia).  The first genome insights for the phylum were published in 2010. Members of the NC10 phylum have been detected in environments including the Brunssummerheide peatlands (Limburg, Netherlands), the deep stratified Lake Zug (Central Switzerland), and a paddy field with long-term fertilization (Hangzhou, China)

It was near Lambese and Thamagada.


Under the Roman Empire, Tigisis was a colony in the province of Numidia.


The account in Procopius's History of the Vandal War of an ancient Punic inscription near the town, which read ""We fled here from the face of Joshua the Robber, son of Nun"", could be the earliest reference to its national identity.


The emperor Justinian had Tigisis fortified with a wall and fourteen towers. Known as TÄ«jis during the Islamic middle ages, the city was captured by a Kutama Berber force led by Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i in the winter of 907-908, during the latter's campaign against the Aghlabid emir in Kairouan. Proceeding eastward along the northern of the two main Roman roads to Kairouan, Abu Abdallah's army laid siege to Tijis and eventually got the 500-strong Aghlabid garrison to surrender in exchange for safe passage.


Tijis was later involved in the founding of the Hammadid dynasty: in 1014, the Zirid emir Badis ibn Mansur designated his son al-Mansur as the crown prince and heir to the throne. Attempting to create a principality for al-Mansur, Badis demanded that his governor Hammad ibn Buluggin hand over the cities of Tijis and Constantine. Hammad refused and declared independence by changing the sovereign's name mentioned in the khutba from that of the Fatimid caliph in Cairo to that of the Sunni Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.


The town of Tigisis was the seat of a bishopric during the Roman, Vandal, and Byzantine eras. The persecution under Diocletian appears to have reached its height in Tigisis during February 304.


Although the diocese ceased to function in the early 7th century, a titular continuation (Latin: Tigistanus in Numidia; Italian: Tigisi di Numidia) was established by the Roman Catholic Church in 1933.",2,19 February 2016, 14 August 2021,41,0,0

Banning was born the son of Jan Banning, a herring fisherman, and Aafke Canrinus.


Thanks to his school teacher in elementary school he was able to attend a teachers college (Rijksnormaalschool) in Haarlem, where he received his teachers certificate in 1907. During his study he became involved in the movement to politically organise  the college students, and in publishing a periodical, the Kweekelingenbode, of which he became the editor in 1908. He was also active in the Kweekelingen Geheelonthoudersbond (a Temperance society). He was hired as a home teacher by a Hoorn notary public to educate his son in the years 1907-1909. During this period he came under the influence of a local clergyman with socialist sympathies, J. Th. Tenthoff, who introduced him to the circle around the Christian Socialist periodical De Blijde Wereld. He also met his future wife, the teacher HenriÃ«tta Johanna Wilhelmina Schoemaker in Hoorn, whom he married on 9 October 1915. They would have three daughters. After a few stints as an elementary-school teacher in the period 1909-1911 his former employer enabled him financially to prepare for the Staatsexamen. [Note 1] He started his studies in theology at Leiden university in 1913. 
There he was a student of P.D. Chantepie de la Sausaye and K.H. Roessingh


Banning had not been politically active before the outbreak of the First World War, but that event motivated him and his future wife to start studying the works of Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky, as he blamed ""capitalism' for the war. He also became a member of the SDAP in 1914.


In 1917 (still a student at Leiden) he was appointed predikant (minister) of the congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in Borculo. In 1920 he became the minister of the Sneek congregation as successor of the Christian-socialist G. HorreÃ¼s de Haas. Meanwhile, in 1916 he and his wife had come in contact with a Dutch group of alumni of the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre. This group formed the Arbeidsgemeenschap der Woodbrookers (Labor community of Woodbrooke alumni) in 1919 of which Banning became chairman. The main aim of the Woodbrookers was to form a link between Socialism and Christianity. Because of his contacts in both the SDAP and the world of Christian socialists Banning soon became the main spokesman of the latter group within the SDAP.


In 1928 he resigned his position as minister and took up his theological studies again. In 1929 he received his Doctorandus degree in theology from Leiden University and started work on a dissertation. In 1931 he published that dissertation about the philosophy of the French Socialist Jean Jaures, entitled Jaures als denker (Jaures as thinker).


In 1929 Banning had been appointed executive director of the Woodbrookers society. He also organised a Congress of Christian socialists in this period that attracted 600 participants. The leadership of the SDAP was keen to encourage this development and Banning was elected a member of the party's governing body in 1931, and of its executive committee in 1935.  In this period he was instrumental in developing a constitutional programme of the SDAP, published in 1935 under the title Het staatkundig stelsel der sociaal-democratie (The constitutional system of social-democracy), and of a new political manifest of the party that was adopted at the 1937 Congress. However, he resigned from the executive committee in protest of the decision to formally abolish the party's pacifist stance in 1937, in reaction to the rise of Nazism as a force that threatened Dutch democracy.[Note 2] He remained a member of the governing body until 1939 when he became editor of the party's ideological publication Socialisme en Democratie (Socialism and Democracy).


After the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940 the German occupation authorities soon made his work impossible, also because he published a number of anti-German pamphlets. In 1942 he was arrested and interned as a hostage in the Gymnasium Beekvliet in Sint-Michielsgestel, together with a number of other prominent Dutchmen. This group of anti-Nazi politicians used their internment to plan a political reform of the Dutch party system for the post-war period. The pre-war system was characterised as a system of Pillarisation that fragmented the Dutch political landscape. The internees resolved to bring an end to this fragmentation.


Immediately after Liberation in 1945 Banning, together with a number of other politicians of different parties, such as Willem Schermerhorn, Piet Lieftinck, Jan de Quay, E.M.J.A. Sassen, and Hendrik Brugmans, formed the Nederlandse Volksbeweging as a movement to bring about what was called the Doorbraak (Breakthrough) of the Pillarisation system. This movement was a main force in bringing about the fusion of the SDAP with two other pre-war political parties, the Free-thinking Democratic League and the Christian Democratic Union, to form the Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA). Banning was chairman of the founding Congress of this party on 9 February 1946, and he also gave the main address.


Though the hoped for doorbraak did not take place, the PvdA played a major role in the post-war part of Dutch  20th-century political history, and Banning for a while became its ""house ideologue"" as editor of Socialisme en Democratie. He coordinated the formulation of several of the PvdA's political manifests in 1947 and 1959, and drafted the official reaction of the party to the Dutch bishops' 1954 advice to Dutch Roman Catholics to vote for the Catholic People's Party.


Already during his internment in the Second World War Banning, under the influence of his fellow hostage Brugmans, had become interested in the philosophy of Personalism, as developed by the circle around the French literary periodical Esprit. He wrote a book that he published after the war under the title De dag van morgen. Schets van een personalistisch socialisme, richtpunt voor de vernieuwing van ons volksleven (The day of tomorrow. Design of a personalistic socialism, target for the renewal of our popular life) in which his own version of this philosophy was expounded. He also took the initiative to the foundation of an institute  for the promotion of the renewal of the Dutch Reformed Church that received the name Kerk en Wereld (Church and World); he became its director for many years. He also was appointed in a chair for Sociology of Religion at Leiden University.


Declining health forced him to resign many of his functions after 1958. The last ten years of his life he drifted into an isolated position. He died on 6 January 1971 in Driebergen.",0,27 February 2019, 5 April 2020,11,0,0

5332817,Goyard,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goyard,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goyard&action=info,"Goyard is a French trunk and leather goods maker. Established in 1853 in Paris, and previously doing business as Martin (Pierre-FranÃ§ois Martin founded the House of Martin in 1792) and then Morel, it is older than Louis Vuitton by one year, although Bally was founded even earlier in 1851. FranÃ§ois Goyard (1828â1890) made box making, packing and trunk making the family's trade when he purchased Maison Morel, successor to Maison Martin. Edmond Goyard (1860â1937) expanded his business from 1885 to 1937. Robert Goyard (1893â1979) was the face of the brand during the booming post-war years. FranÃ§ois Goyard played a significant role in further increasing the firm's growth with his daughter Isabelle Goyard (1959-). Jean-Michel Signoles bought Goyard in 1998, and turned the privately owned company into an internationally renowned brand.


The brand is known for a certain amount of secrecy, with little knowing where the iconic interlocking Chevron pattern, seen on many Goyard bags, originates from. Goyard eschews self-promotion, advertising, e-commerce, and refuses to grant interviews.


Maison Morel was the official purveyor of Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchess de Berry, an honour that granted it the title of ""box maker, trunk maker and packer of Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Berry"". Maison Martin's store sign featured references to the three traditional crafts of ""box making, trunk making and packing"" that were at the core of its business, which was advertised as follows: "" ""Maison Martin sells an assortment of boxes and cases; it provides quality packing services for fragile furniture and objects, as well as hats, gowns and flowers; it uses oiled canvas, plain canvas and straw for packing; manufacturer of horse carriage trunks and coat racks, it also supplies oilcloth and waterproof canvas, all at a fair price.""



Pierre FranÃ§ois Martin was the guardian of a young female ward, Pauline Moutat, and gave his business as her dowry. He was also instrumental in arranging her marriage to one of his employees, Louis-Henri Morel (1817â1852), who was twenty-three at the time. Morel followed on Martin's footsteps, and introduced himself as the ""Successor to former Maison Morel, located on rue Neuve-des-Capucines, near Place VendÃ´me."" In turn, Louis-Henri Morel, passed on his skills and knowledge to a seventeen-year-old apprentice by the name of 
FranÃ§ois Goyard, whom he hired in 1845. The apprentice received a state-of-the-art training under the dual guidance of Pierre FranÃ§ois Martin and Louis-Henri Morel. Monsieur Morel died suddenly on 24 August 1852. In a short time, the house's corporate name changed from Morel to Goyard, and from Goyard to Goyard AinÃ© (French for ""elder"", FranÃ§ois being the firstborn among Goyard brothers), as to differentiate himself from his siblings. When he died, FranÃ§ois Goyard left his son Edmond with a very reputable business with workshops in Bezons,Â Â·  a city in the northwestern suburbs of Paris.


In 1834, Pierre FranÃ§ois Martin moved his store from 4, Rue Neuve des Capucines, where Louis Vuitton opened in 1854, to 347, rue Saint-HonorÃ©. On account of the new street numbering policy implemented in Paris in 1856, the address changed to 233, rue Saint-HonorÃ©. His successors remain stuck in this spot at the corner of rue Saint-HonorÃ© and rue de Castiglione, near Place VendÃ´me.


Edmond Goyard, drawing on his father FranÃ§ois Goyard's work, turned the store on rue Saint-HonorÃ© into an increasingly elitist luxury brand with an international clientele. He created the first Goyard advertisements, participated in various World Expositions and opened four branch stores. He also laid the foundations for the brand as we know it today, as he came up with the emblematic Goyardine canvas, launched a pet accessories range and developed products for automobiles. He partnered with his eldest son Robert, and together they ran E. Goyard AÃ®nÃ© et Fils (E.Goyard Elder and Son). Robert followed his father's footsteps and ran the business from 1937 to 1979.


The Goyards originated from Clamecy in Burgundy, where the family males had long worked as log drivers. They were members of the Compagnons de RiviÃ¨re, a guild of transporters moving firewood to Paris.Â Â·  The family name ""Goyard"" derives from the French ""goujard"", also spelled ""goyard"". This sickle-like tool with a blade attached to a two-metre-long strong wooden handle was used by the Bourguignon people from the Aube area to cut thorns they would then transplant onto hedgerow stakes.


In 1832, a massive cholera epidemic decimated the population of Clamecy. On 17 December, EdmÃ© Goyard's father died at the age of 72. His son subsequently left the hamlet with his wife and two sons, FranÃ§ois and Claude, who were respectively four and two-years old. The family settled down in Paris and soon welcomed another son, Martin, who was born on 10 October 1833.


After a thirty-two-year-tenure as head of business, FranÃ§ois handed the company over to his 25-year-old eldest son Edmond on April ""1st"", 1885. The house changed its name to E. Goyard AÃ®nÃ©, and became a key player in the development of the industry of luxury travel items over the next few decades.


Just like his father did, Robert ran the store until his demise in 1979. His impact on the house proved considerable, as he constantly updated the range of products, notably by developing a new canvas. He patented the design for this woven canvas in 1965. The Chevron pattern remained, and the overall design was simplified, as the production process required, leaving the canvas bare of any name.


Robert Goyard was also determined to contribute to the prestige of his neighbourhood. On 9 December 1936, the Place VendÃ´me Association was set up; on 25 July 1944, an extraordinary general meeting aiming to reform the association was held. The association initially changed its name to ""Place VendÃ´me, Rue de la Paix and surroundings"" before opting for ""ComitÃ© VendÃ´me"", its current name. Robert Goyard was instrumental in setting up this cooperative agreement by taking care of the formalities for its constitution and locating its offices at Goyard's headquarters at 233, rue Saint-HonorÃ©.


Jean Edmond FranÃ§ois was the son of Robert Goyard, and collaborated with his father. The Occupation took its toll on the house, and the store at 233, rue Saint-HonorÃ© closed down temporarily. FranÃ§ois took a stake in the family business on 25 May 1951, which became a limited company four days later. After the end of World War II, Robert resumed running the company until 1979; upon his death, his granddaughter Isabelle Goyard took over with the help of her father.[citation needed]


In 1998, a purchaser took over from the Goyard family: Jean-Michel Signoles, a keen collector of all things Goyard, undertook the challenge of reinventing Goyard with the help of his sons. Without the backing of a leading luxury brand group, he exploited the heritage of the house, built new workshops in Carcassonne, France, and opened retail stores all over the world.


FranÃ§ois Goyard, like Louis Vuitton, did not participate in the 1885 World Exposition, the first one to take place in Paris, as they both had started their respective business too recently. Under the guidance of Edmond Goyard, Goyard moved ahead in a new strategic direction and participated in a world exposition for the first time in 1900.


At the World Exposition of Paris that was held from 14 April to 12 November, Goyard won a bronze medal: ""Mr Goyard AinÃ© from Paris displays in his stand a whole range of trunks, briefcases, suitcases, cases and so on. We also took notice of coat racks, toiletry sets coming with or without accessories, wicker baskets covered in waterproof canvas available in a variety of shades; everything denotes a quintessentially Parisian and tasteful craftsmanship.""


Edmond Goyard participated in the World Exposition of Milan that was held from 28 April â 11 November 1906. The main examiner, Victor le Renard, concluded: ""French items are once again preferred when it comes to craftsmanship and taste."" Edmond Goyard won a gold medal.


The Franco-British Exposition was held in London from May to November 1908. Victor le Renard, the main examiner, noted that British manufacturers had failed to enter the contest, and deplored it. French manufacturers were hardly more enthusiastic when it came to respond to the persistent solicitations of the selection committee, as only two of them took part in the exposition: Goyard and Louis Vuitton. Edmond Goyard won a gold medal.


The World Exposition in Brussels was held from 23 April â 7 November 1910, and featured the same three major Parisian houses as in Milan: Goyard, Louis Vuitton and Artus. Goyard was awarded an honorary degree during the Exposition, which turned out to be the most visited since 1900.


Ãtienne BÃ©raud, the exposition's examiner, spoke highly of Goyard: ""Goyard AÃ®nÃ© is one-hundred-and nineteen-years-old. It was established in 1792 in Paris"". ""


At the Anglo-Latin Exposition of London that took place in Great White City, Goyard was featured in the section V of the competition (""Section of various industries""), within the ""bodywork, automobiles and wooden accessories, tourism"" division. This class was presided by the Frenchman LÃ©on Auscher, one of the most prestigious coachbuilders to call upon Goyard to make car trunks. Goyard's commercial catalogue was testament to the heavy influence of mail coaches on the design of car trunks. Goyard won a grand prix. Examiner Henri Pichot added: ""Goyard specializes in trunks and travel goods. It operates two branch stores, one in Monte-Carlo, the other in Biarritz.""


It was held from 26 April â 3 November 1913. Goyard was awarded a Grand Prix, and the exposition's reviewer, Mister Lamy-Torrilhon, stated how important Goyard was: ""It employs a large number of workers and shop clerks, whether in Paris or at its branch stores in Monte-Carlo and Biarritz. Its goods are remarkable for their elegance and level of craftsmanship, two qualities that combine to produce, for instance, state-of-the-art drawer trunks equipped with double door and props to keep drawers ajar, cases for gloves, handkerchiefs, linen and so on"". The Class 99 International Jury gave Goyard a citation for its excellence, as it had previously been awarded a grand prix. Mr Goyard was made an Academic Officer (an Order of Chivalry of France for academics and cultural and educational figures) right after the World Exposition of Brussels in 1910.


As World War I made it impossible for events to be held in Europe, Edmond Goyard decided to participate in a US-based exposition for the very first time. He travelled to San Francisco and was the brand ambassador during the event. The Panama Pacific Exposition proved to be a major success with 30,000 exhibitors and 18.9 million visitors between 20 February â 4 December 1915. Goyard performed on a non-competitive basis in the Class XXXV category (""Goods from Paris, Travel Items, Music Instruments""). Unfortunately, the detailed list of exhibitors is not featured in the competition final report.


As a result of post-war difficulties, the Strasbourg Exposition was a small-scale event. It was mostly designed to celebrate the return of Alsace and Lorraine to France. Three exhibitors entered the competition in the Travel items Class: Bourson, Goyard and Louis Vuitton. As Edmond Goyard was a substitute judge for the class, Goyard performed on a non-competitive basis. Class examiner Gaston Roux was a passionate advocate of French colours: ""In this area, we can only claim superiority for one thing, but it is overwhelming: French luxury trunks are by far the best. They are tasteful, renowned and sought after the world over. As a result, French major brands opened successful branch stores in the US and the UK. Yet there are not that many of them, and that is the reason why only three exhibitors participated in the Exposition.""


This event was commissioned in 1912 to be held in 1915, but ended up being postponed for another ten years. Paul LÃ©on, the examiner for the Class 9 of the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts, stressed that ""manufacturers such as IsraÃ«l, Silberstein, Amson, and Goyard display a very elevated view of French leather goods. IsraÃ«l and Silberstein excel at crafting highly creative womenâs bags, Amson gives a new meaning to mass production with its use of fine materials and its sober and clever designs, whilst Goyard reigns supreme on sport and travel items.""


Goyard's letterhead paper dated 24 June 1891 bore the coats of arms of the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire and the Great Seal of the United States of America. The queens of Yugoslavia and Greece became customers after World War II, whilst the Duke and Duchess of Windsor purchased their first Goyard goods in 1939. High-profile purchasers such as the Grimaldis or the Maharajah of Kapurthala rub shoulders with celebrities, socialites or first ladies like Catherine Deneuve, Ãdith Piaf, Romy Schneider, Jean-Claude Brialy, who acquired his first Goyard pieces in 1974, Mrs Georges Pompidou, who became a client from 1963 onwards, princess AndrÃ©e Aga Khan (1956), princess Radziwill (1949) or the prince and princess von FÃ¼rstenberg (1968). Contemporary glitterati like Madonna, Victoria Beckham, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy are regularly spotted wearing Goyard bags. Rapper Kanye West mentioned his affinity for Goyard trunks in the 2007 song, The Glory. Rapper Rich the Kid filmed a music video in a Goyard store.


This coated cloth was already around for the World Exposition in 1900, and was used in the inter-war years. It remains unchanged up to the present time, in its chevron pattern. In 2002, exactly 110 years after its creation, the Signoles family inaugurated their tenure at the helm of Goyard with the introduction of twelve new colours on top of the historic black canvas. The Goyardine canvas is now available in red, green, sky-blue, navy-blue, yellow, white...


Right from the start, Goyardine was made with cloth, although its appearance is very similar to leather. Goyard uses three plant fibres: hemp, linen, and cotton. Hemp is particularly sought after for its hydrophobic qualities, linen is a fine thermal regulator, and the softness of linen probably caught the attention of the trunk maker.


The initial meters of Goyardine were most likely hand-painted. When the Goyardine was launched, the workshops moved to Bezons, and the manufacturing of the canvas required a ground-colour application followed by three successive layers of etching colours. The trademark slightly raised pattern of the Goyardine results from both the cloth and the printing technique used during the manufacturing process: the plain weave shows through the Chevron pattern, and superimposes on top of the raised pattern produced by the paint dots. The overall effect is absolutely unique, and near impossible to counterfeit.


The dots on the fabric supposedly represent three chevrons juxtaposed to form a Y, the central letter in the Goyard family name. Edmond Goyard used the three chevrons of the letter Y to sign his canvas just like a painter would sign his painting: his name written in white is the only element that truly stands out, while the address of the Paris store is spelled in two different shades of brown, and ""Paris"" is repeated twice, and arranged in a centrally symmetrical stack. Edmond Goyard was the very first trunk maker to build his name into his canvas, and did so even before the year 1900. The piled up dot pattern was clearly inspired by the Goyard family history, and evokes their ""Compagnon de riviÃ¨re""(log drivers) ancestors.


If Edmond Goyard left his mark on the history of the brand by creating the Goyardine, his son Robert also created a new fabric: a four-shade-woven canvas. This canvas is used in bags designed for frequent air travel. Robert Goyard patented his new canvas on 24 November 1965, and described its design as ""Chevrons intertwined with linear stripes."" This new canvas not only allows for a more modern look: for it is a woven canvas, it is also much softer than the historic Goyard canvas, thus making it possible to manufacture new products. In order to improve the solidity of the weaving, Robert Goyard altered the pattern in 1968, and came up with a totally updated version that is easily recognizable from the previous one, as it is much more even.


In 2010, Goyard marketed for the very first time a canvas woven on a jacquard loom. This jacquard canvas constitutes a major technical feat, as it builds ""E.Goyard"" into the lighter-shaded thread of the canvas, a previously unheard-of achievement in the textile industry. The new canvas is currently available in a black-charcoal grey-dove grey-white colour palette, and will shortly be available in other shades.


This extremely rare canvas was developed in collaboration with Suzanne Lenglen in the 1930s; its production stopped when the tennis player died in 1938. Goyard reprinted this canvas, which is now available again for special orders only, as quantities produced are limited.


Nowadays, special orders are to be placed at the store at 233, rue Saint-HonorÃ©, as it was the case when the factory was located in Bezons. Special orders are entirely hand-made in the Goyard workshops in southern France, in the Aude department. The workshops are installed in converted wine warehouses. Whilst some trunk makers specialize in standardized goods, Goyard is equally at ease with both special orders and ready-made items. Among the many extravagant special orders that Goyard was able to deliver over the course of its history, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Writerâs trunk"" certainly stands out. In the report he wrote for the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in 1925, Paul LÃ©on lists its main characteristics: ""The trunk is equipped with a filing cabinet, a bookcase, a typewriter and a foldable desk."" The descriptive text that goes with its patent spares no detail either: ""All kinds of kits and sets can be placed in the pigeonhole located in the trunk lid, along with photograph frames, a watch, a thermometer and a barometer"". After the death of the creator of Sherlock Holmes on 7 July 1930, Edmond Goyard registered a patent for the trunk on 20 July 1931, and seldom remanufactured this exceptional piece.


Each order is the result of a special encounter: that taking place between the trunk maker and the customer. When it comes to special orders, everything is possible: a trunk especially designed to carry and store caviar, or to meet the needs of a sportsperson, a fabulous picnic trunk.


Each piece of hard-sided luggage by Goyard is entirely hand made by a specific trunk maker, according to the highest, strictest standards. When the crafting process is over, the trunk maker writes down the serial number of the piece they made on its identification tag, along with their initials. They also write down that same serial number in the manufacturing register that has been keeping track of all items made by the Goyard workshops ever since Jean-Michel Signoles took over. The manufacturing register is used as a reference in the event an item needs to be repaired. About twenty trunk makers work in the Goyard workshops and specialize in made-to-order trunks and hard-sided luggage.


When several members of a same family travel together, their luggage stripes are identical, and it is difficult to tell which piece of luggage belongs to whom. In France, tradition dictates that each piece should be monogrammed with the initials of its owner, whereas in the UK, it is customary to use the owner's full first and last names, whether they are a royal or a commoner. Initials have been used for a long time, as evidenced by the wooden trunk the compagnons de riviÃ¨re used to carry along with them on their timber raft. It was the only valuable object on board, and it was used to protect food and personal belongings from the waters of the river. Over the course of time, it became a token of remembrance, reminding its owner of the many travels he made. It was monogrammed with its owner's initials and also stamped with the employers' logo. FranÃ§ois Goyard's grandfather was a compagnon de riviÃ¨re, and he owned a monogrammed trunk long before the family went into the trunk making business.  Stripes perpetuate old traditions, notably those related to horse carriages, which were painted in the colours of each family.


Goyard's monograms are hand-painted onto the Goyardine canvas and can be customized with a variety of different colours. The revival of customized leather goods, whether they are adorned with initials, stripes or coats of arms, proved Goyard's answer to the logo craze.


Apart from the main boutique in Paris, Goyard also has freestanding monobrand stores in: 


Its retail spaces in luxury department stores include:


In 2008, Goyard opened a boutique called ""Le Chic du Chien"" (Canine Chic) entirely dedicated to pet accessories and excursion items at 352, rue Saint-HonorÃ©, right across the street from its historic store at 233, rue Saint-HonorÃ©. Edmond Goyard was very keen on developing a range of pet accessories, as evidenced by catalogues and invoices dating from as far back as 1890. The Goyard range for pets comprised items for dogs, cats and even monkeys. Edmond Goyard hired the most sought-after illustrators of his time, such as the likes of Benjamin Rabier and Pierre Falize, the latter being also the creator of famous posters for iconic Parisian Restaurant Prunier, to work on the Chic du Chien commercial catalogues.


Ever since it started in 1994, Goyard has been a supporter of Sidaction, a major French public event for raising awareness and collecting charitable funds for AIDS. Goyard donates prestigious prizes for the annual Fashion Dinner's raffle, in order to fund initiatives against AIDS, whether research programs, patient assistance or prevention schemes. Goyard is also a supporter of the annual AVEC (Association pour la Vie, Espoir contre le Cancer, a not-for-profit organisation fighting cancer) evening. At the end of the charity dinner organized at the Palace of Versailles in January 2012, ""the auction was equally fun and lucrative: the Goyard prize (a hard-sided suitcase worth 4700 euros) was auctioned three times and finally repurchased by the very man who had donated it in the first place, Jean-Michel Signoles, president of Goyard, who ended up offering it to French TV show host StÃ©phane Bern.""


For the third edition of Un bagage pour la vie, un bagage pour Curie, Goyard organized an auction of customized bags and luggage to raise money for the leading cancer research centre Institut Curie in Paris. The patron of the event was AmÃ©lie Mauresmo, and the pieces auctioned off were sponsored by twenty-one female personalities from the worlds of cinema, fashion and sport: Sarah Biasini, Ãlodie Bouchez, CÃ©cile Cassel, Audrey Dana, Emma de Caunes, Catherine Deneuve, ZoÃ© Felix, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Vahina Giocante, Judith GodrÃ¨che, Audrey Marnay, Chiara Mastroianni, AmÃ©lie Mauresmo, Mathilda May, HÃ©lÃ©na Noguerra, GÃ©raldine Pailhas, Vanessa Paradis, Linh-Dan Pham, Barbara Schultz, Audrey Tautou, and Elsa Zylberstein. Each personality was invited by Goyard to use the iconic chevron pattern canvas to express their own vision of travelling: stripes of colour, messages or drawings. Their imagination combined to Goyard's know-how resulted in twenty-one unique pieces auctioned at Christie's in Paris.Â Â· 


The Goyard art book published by Devambez is the reference publication upon Parisian trunk makers. It was dubbed ""a luxury bible"" by Suzy Menkes in the article called ""A tender Tome of Art and Heart"" that she wrote in the New York Times on 15 June 2010. The book had a print run of 233 copies, a reference to the address of the Goyard historic store that has been located at 233, rue Saint HonorÃ© since 1834. It will never be republished and is visible by appointment only in the Goyard Paris shop.


The Goyard art book pays tribute to the golden days of luxury travelling, from horse carriage to ocean liners. It retraces the history of Goyard and is showcased in a special made-to-order trunk that is altogether a jewel case and a book's binding (sewing). Each individual purchaser is invited to make their named copy into a unique piece by picking the colour for the trunk canvas, which can also be initialled or adorned with stripes in the shades of their choice. Copies are numbered from 1 to 233, and that number is specified both on the trunk and in the book.Â Â·  The Goyard art book is printed on watermarked deckled vellum paper that was custom-made by Arches, France's most renowned papermakers. Lead letterpress techniques have been used for the texts. The Goyard art book is featured in the collections of the National Library of France, the BibliothÃ¨que des Arts DÃ©coratifs in Paris and the Kunstbibliothek in Berlin.",0,29 May 2006, 23 July 2021,357,0,0

The corps core objectives includes research and development, tests, and management of the military communications and information systems support for the command and control of the combined arms forces.


Initially part of Indian Army Corps of Signals which was established by Royal Engineers in 1911, its members and officers closely allied itself with Royal Corps of Signals, actively participated shoulder-to-shoulder in World War II, at a time when Germany invaded Great Britain.  It came to existence on 14 August 1947, when Indian Army Corps of Signals was divided into two parts by the British Government, with one part remaining in India while other units formed what is now known as Corps of Signals in Pakistan. It was the brain-child of British Army's intelligence officer Major-General R. Cawthome who also founded and established the premier ISI in 1948. The Corps was supplemented with Royal Corps of Signals officers to assist into building the Corps to working strength. As soon as the Pakistan Army's signal officer were trained, the officer quickly replaced the British signal officers and closely allied the Corps with U.S. Army Signal Corps where the U.S. Signal Corps further provided advanced military training to the Corps of Signals.


Major. General. Obedur Rehman was the first SO-in-C of the Corps of Signals. On March 23, 1956, the Corps was re-designed as Corps of Signals, and more objectives were made responsible to Corps. In 1948, the Corps established the Military College of Signals to train the personnel and officers for the Corps. A major re-organization were carried out when Corps officers also helped established the Joint Signal Intelligence (JSI) and the Corps nomenclature was also changed. The regiments and squadrons became as battalions and companies.  In 1962, the unit was sent to Iran to help built the Iranian Army's own Signal corps, and as for its war capabilities, the Corps took participation in 1947 war, 1965 war, 1971 war, 1999 war, with India. The Corps was also involved with Afghanistan war, Bosnian war, and the Bangladesh war, making the Corps as Pakistan Army's principle combatant arm.


As for its capabilities in science and technology, the Corps worked closely with Defence Science and Technology Organization (DESTO) to develop command and control software, and is notable for its participation for developing the communication system for Badr-II satellite.

In addition to the lab experience, students receive a stipend.


Participating institutions include Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York University, and Columbia University.


Students undertake their own research, which is presented during a street science fair in their own community, under the guidance of scientists. The students are able to pursue their scientific investigations during the following school semester in an after-school program.  Additionally, these students attend weekly lectures on a variety of topics ranging from incorporating science into communities to financing a college education, while also having the option to visit college campuses and to receive help preparing for the SATs.


Dr. Sat (Satyajit) Bhattacharya founded HCS on June 5, 2000.  By 2010, the program had expanded to 12 countries, serving more than 750 students. Of their mentees in the United States, as of 2010, 40% are African-American, 26% are of Hispanic descent, and 16% are Native Americans.


HCS aims to increase awareness in the sciences, medicine, engineering and mathematics.  It provides an opportunity for under-privileged high school aged students throughout to world succeed academically as well as in all other aspects of their lives.


HCS as of the 2013 serves about 60 students from over 15 schools doing hands-on science research with over 20 mentors in more than 10 reputed institutions.[citation needed]


The Program has three components: Students and research projects; seminars and training; and local, regional and national professional conferences and community science street fairs.  Family involvement and post-program follow-up provide students with support to plan their futures and mediate the transitions----academic, emotional, and social----to college and post-academic pursuits.[citation needed]


Depending on their interests and availability of recruited mentors, students are matched with a mentor willing to commit to the summer program.  These students enter the program at the beginning of the summer with an orientation, and spend about eight 25-hour weeks starting their research and some receive training in lab techniques and safety.  During the academic year, a fraction of the participating students put in 12â24 hours each month at their internship sites and attend weekly seminars when made available.[citation needed]


A fraction of the students stay committed to the program for at least two years, and are requested to work as part of HCS staff by Bhattacharya as volunteer interns with an unfixed stipend every year.[citation needed]

Megalocephalus was an amphibian, measuring 1.5 metres (4.9Â ft) from head to tail.


It is only known from its skull, like most other baphetids. The skull of Megalocephalus was 30 centimetres (12Â in) long. The teeth of Megalocephalus were long and pointed. Baphetids had a small elongation of their eye sockets, of which the current use for is not certain. It has been suggested that the elongation was housing for a salt gland to get rid of excess salt, or an extra region for jaw muscle attachments, to allow a harder bite force.

Hamel has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al (UQAM).


Hamel first ran for city council in the 1998 municipal election as Vision Montreal's candidate for Saint-Pierre. She lost to longtime incumbent Germain PrÃ©gent of New Montreal.


Hamel ran again in the 2001 municipal election and was elected for the Louis-Cyr division. She was re-elected in the 2005 election in the renamed division of Saint-HenriâLa Petite-BourgogneâPointe-Saint-Charles. Both elections were won by GÃ©rald Tremblay's Montreal Island Citizens Union (MICU), and Hamel served as a member of the opposition. By virtue of serving on city council, Hamel was also a member of the Sud-Ouest borough council; in 2007, she supported a measure to permit bars and restaurants on Monk Street to construct frontal terraces.


In September 2007, Hamel's father, Michel Hamel, was charged with three counts of fraud pertaining to accusations that he had taken money from a local developer in return for seeking to obtain a zoning change.

The PADME mission competed for Discovery Program funding, but lost to the Psyche and Lucy missions. The Principal Investigator is Anthony Colaprete. Other principals include Pascal Lee (Deputy Principal Investigator) and Butler Hine (Project Manager).


The origin of Mars' satellites, which were discovered by astronomer Asaph Hall, remains unknown. PADME would advance the scientific understanding of the origin of Phobos and Deimos by studying:


In addition, PADME would assess potential resources (water, organics, regolith) and potential hazards (dust) that Phobos and Deimos might present for future human exploration in Mars orbit.


Once in Mars orbit, PADME would carry out 16 flybys of Phobos followed by 9 flybys of Deimos. Flybys would take place at two-week intervals. Flyby altitudes at closest approach to Phobos and Deimos would be ~2Â km. Following completion of its primary mission, PADME could remain in high Mars orbit for long-term monitoring of the martian system and search for potential additional moonlets around Mars. Alternatively, PADME could be made to escape Mars and eventually fly by a Near-Earth Object (NEO).


NASA Ames Research Center would design, develop, build, and test the PADME spacecraft, and manage mission operations. The proposal is to employ the proven Modular Common Spacecraft Bus (MCSB), previously used by the  LADEE Moon orbiter. Major partners include the SETI Institute, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.


The PADME mission has four science instruments plus a radio science experiment which uses the spacecraft's radio communications system.


The orbiter could also carry an optional laser communications experiment.


PADME could launch on a Medium-lift class launch vehicle. The spacecraft would fit within all Atlas V, Delta IV, and Falcon 9 launch vehicle fairings. If selected, PADME would have been launched in August 2020 and reached Mars seven months later, by March 2021.

The first of The Diamond Brothers series, it was first published in 1986. The title is a spoof of The Maltese Falcon, to which there are various allusions throughout the story. The novel was adapted for the 1988 film Just Ask for Diamond.


Early on the book, Nick Simple (who narrates the story) explains that, before he went to live with his older brother Herbert, he had lived with his parents in a part of London called Wiernotta Mews (word play on Queen Victoria's famous phrase We're not amused). At the time, his parents planned to fly (with Nick) to Australia. Herbert had joined the police (one week before the local training station was destroyed in a fire, largely implied to be Herbert's fault), and could look after himself, more or less.


Nick, not wanting to go to Australia, managed to flee London Heathrow Airport at the last minute, leaving his parents to fly off to Sydney on their own, and going to live with Herbert. In the later stories he sometimes wishes he is still with his parents, mainly due to Herbert being such an awful and embarrassing guardian and the fact that their current financial situation is so bad. Herbert has been sacked, having shot the weapons training instructor in a freak accident and caused various other mishaps during his two months at Ladbroke Grove, and has set up a detective agency under the name ""Tim Diamond"".


Nicholas 'Nick' Simple and his older brother, Herbert Simple, meet Johnny Naples, a dwarf, who comes to the office carrying a suspicious package, and acting as if he is being trailed. He tries to explain the situation, whilst Herbert unsuccessfully tries to affect a hardman act.


Dumbfounded as to why Johnny Naples would pay them 200 pounds to look after a box of chocolates, they visit the (fictional) Hotel Splendide after a quick enquiry at a shop traced using a sign on the envelope, with the keeper saying that the owner of a hotel in Portobello Road mentioned to him that a dwarf was staying at his hotel.


A plain-clothes police man, disguised as a drunk in the street, arrests them and they are sent to Ladbroke Grove Police Station, where Herbert's old boss, Chief Inspector Snape, accompanied by his violent assistant Boyle, arrives to question them. Snape who previously could not bear Herbert during his service there begins to form a grudging respect for Nick when he realises how smart he is for his age. When Nick offers to tell Snape everything the Diamonds know in exchange for what the police know, Snape begins to tell his story.


After finding a matchbox from a nightclub called The Casablanca Club (an acknowledgment to another one of Humphrey Bogart's movies), they decide to pay the club a visit. At home they find the Club is open, but their cleaning lady Betty Charlady says no good will come of it.


Quickly, they find that Naples must have been a regular there â a waiter mistakes Nick for him, and offers him a bottle of free champagne, and a singer called Lauren Bacardi (a take-off of film noir star and Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall) asks of Johnny's well-being. However, just moments after the brothers feel they are making progress, Bacardi is snatched by two shady figures in a blue van. Nick manages to step onto the back of the van, but soon is thrown off and into a wall of cardboard boxes. It is then revealed that Lauren has stolen the diamonds because she worked out the truth. As a parting gift she sends Nick and Herbert a Malteser with a diamond inside. Nick after realising this great wealth decides go skiing for their Christmas holidays. However Herbert breaks his leg before they get on the plane and the money is spent on medical bills.


In this book, Nick calls his brother by his real name, Herbert, but in all following books he calls his brother Tim Diamond and calls himself Nick Diamond not Nicholas Simple or Herbert Simple for his brother.


The film, Just Ask for Diamond, also known as Diamond's Edge, based on the novel, was released in 1988. 


A stage adaptation, The Falcon's Malteser by Anthony Horowitz adapted for the stage by New Old Friends,  has been produced by New Old Friends theatre company (Feargus Dunlop & Heather Westwell) with input on the script from Horowitz himself.

The settlers organised themselves into informal associations (similar to the Kongsi organisations found in other Chinese communities), and chose a leader from among themselves. In Chinese, ""Kangchu"" (Chinese: æ¸¯ä¸», Pinyin: GÃ¡ng ZhÇ, Teochew: Kaang6 Zhu8) literally means âmaster of the riverbankâ, and was the title given to the Chinese headmen of these river settlements.[fn 2] The ""Kangchu"" leaders are also called ""Kapitan"".


The term ""Kangchu"" became widely used during the 19th century, as Chinese immigrants began to settle in and around Johor state and set up gambier and pepper[fn 3] plantations. The social and economic welfare of the early Chinese settlers came under the charge of local Chinese leaders, who were responsible for running these agricultural plantations, which were situated along the river banks. The Kangchu system traces its origins from the 18th century when Chinese coolies settled in Penang and Riau and set up gambier and pepper plantations there. The sovereign rulers of Johor, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim and his son and successor, Sultan Abu Bakar, took up the Kangchu system during the first half of the 19th century to provide a more organised form of administration as Chinese immigrants began to settle in the state in great numbers and developed the state's agricultural economy.
Variants of the Kangchu system also thrived in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, where gambier and pepper were cultivated and where there were significant Chinese populations. The Kangchu and coolies who worked in the gambier and pepper plantations were mainly of Teochew origin, and were generally first- or second-generation Chinese immigrants. In 1917, the British colonial government in Johor implemented an act which abolished the Kangchu system in the state, and the value for gambier declined during the early 20th century.


The origins of the Kangchu system dates back to the mid-18th century, when early Chinese settlers in Penang experimented in cash crop plantations with various types of crops, including pepper, gambier, betelnut and clove. The plantations were abandoned by the late 18th-century, as Penang experienced wars from Buginese seafarers that resulted in many gambier plantations being destroyed; contributing to the decline in plantations was the growing popularity of the spice trade that reaped much greater profits. At the beginning of the 19th century, these Chinese settlers began to look south to Malacca and Singapore, where gambier and pepper plantations had also been established.


In the late 1820s, Chinese settlers from Singapore also began to look towards Johor for gambier and pepper cultivation at the encouragement of Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his successor, Daeng Ibrahim. As more Chinese settlers established gambier and pepper plantations in Johor during the 1840s, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim formed a bureaucracy made up of Malay officials to oversee administrative affairs upon the Kangchu.  He began issuing official permits, known as Surat Sungai (transliterated as ""river documents"") in Malay, to the Kangchu (leaders of the settlers) which permitted them to establish these plantations along the river banks. In turn, the Kangchu were required to pay taxes from the profits generated by the gambier and pepper farms and the Surat Sungai, which had to be renewed after a specified period of time.


The first gambier and pepper plantations appeared in Southern Johor, notably Skudai. Lau Lib Keng, a Chinese settler based in Skudai, was the first person to receive a Surat Sungai, whereby the river banks of Skudai were leased to Lau for the cultivation of gambier and pepper. More Chinese settlers came to Johor from the 1850s onwards, and forested areas in Southern Johor such as Tebrau, Plentong and Stulang were cleared for the cultivation of gambier and pepper. By the time Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim's son, Abu Bakar took office from his father in 1862, at least 37 Surat Sungai have been issued to various Kangchu, all of whom were collectively responsible for the operations of the 1,200 gambier and pepper farms in the state. Most of these Chinese leaders were also members of secret societies, and communal warfare often broke out in Singapore between different dialect groups as a result of conflicting economic interests. From the late 1850s onwards, the Kangchu began to exert political influence in the state affairs by establishing close ties with Temenggong Abu Bakar. In 1865, Abu Bakar granted official recognition to the Teochew-dominated Johor branch of the Ngee Heng Kongsi after a Kangchu, Tan Kee Soon, raised a small army to subdue Sultan Ali's forces, from whom Abu Bakar was facing considerable dissent but was unable to raise an organised army. Abu Bakar nevertheless called for the Ngee Heng Kongsi to accept Chinese settlers of other dialect groups to prevent possible communal warfare as a result of conflicting economic interests.


The crop produce from these plantations were generally exported to other countries from Singapore with the assistance of Chinese merchants based in that city. From the 1860s onwards, many of these Kangchu chalked up debts and began to sell their property rights to these merchants or to larger business magnates (Kongsi in Teochew) based in Singapore, who were known to the locals as Tuan Sungai (literally Masters of the River). The Kangchu then were often hired as supervisors or managers by the merchants to keep watch on the day-to-day operations of the gambier and pepper plantations. Temenggong Abu Bakar began to issue contract-style letters of recognition to these Kangchu; the letters were known by their Malay name Surat Tauliah.


As the gambier and pepper plantations expanded in the 1870s, the more established Kangchu were entrusted with larger blocks of farms and made contracts with Chinese merchants from Singapore. The profits generated from harvests of these plantations formed the bulk of Johor's economy, and financed the development of Johor's infrastructure. Abu Bakar's relationship with the Chinese leaders was excellent, and he appointed many of them to political positions in the state. Of particular note, Abu Bakar appointed two Chinese leaders to the Johor State Council: a Kangchu from Chaozhou, Tan Hiok Nee, and a contractor from Taishan, Wong Ah Fook, who also owned gambier and pepper farms in Mersing in the 1880s. As the land along the river banks in Southern Johor was already taken by the earlier waves of Chinese settlers, newer Chinese settlers began migrating northwards in the 1870s and established new gambier and pepper plantations further north; new plantations were established in Yong Peng, Batu Pahat, Benut, Endau and Kota Tinggi. In particular, Abu Bakar actively encouraged Chinese settlers to establish plantations in Muar, shortly after the British Colonial Government ruled in favour of Abu Bakar over Tengku Alam Shah (Sultan Ali's eldest son) and his family, and granted Abu Bakar control of Muar.


At the end of the 19th century, Johor's economy began to diversify from gambier and pepper plantations to other agricultural crops. Starting with coffee in 1881,  crops such as tapioca, tea, pineapple and rubber were introduced into the state. Coffee and tapioca was quickly abandoned in the 1890s when the value of these crops experienced a drop, while rubber was introduced and quickly established a strong foothold in Johor, as the world demand for rubber increased greatly around 1910. Prices for gambier plunged between 1905 and 1906, and many Kangchu abandoned gambier in favour of rubber. Further decline in the number of gambier and pepper plantations was fuelled by the colonial government's suppression of traditional farming methods employed by the Kangchu for planting gambier and pepper; these method led to soil exhaustion and a depletion of forests which was used as firewood in small factories. A few years before the Kangchu system was abolished, exports for both gambier and pepper plunged by a further 60% between 1912 and 1917.


The British had long frowned upon the Kangchu because of their links with secret societies in Singapore as well as their indulgence in social vices such as gambling and opium smoking, activities which the British had been actively suppressing in Singapore and the Federated Malay States. As early as 1890, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Cecil Clementi Smith had lobbied Abu Bakar to adopt the Societies Ordinance and ban the Ngee Heng Kongsi, but was promptly turned down. Shortly after the British appointed an adviser to Johor, the British began attributing the high crime rates in the state to Chinese settlers loyal to the Kangchu. In 1915, the Johor state government, now effectively under the control of the British Colonial Government, passed the Societies Enactment which prompted the dissolution of the Ngee Heng Kongsi the following year. The Kangchu system was officially abolished December 1917 in an enactment passed by the Johor state government, which was by then effectively administered by the British colonial government.


The Temenggong of Johor (later Sultan of Johor) conferred upon the Kangchu with a large degree of administrative autonomy within the plot of land which each was granted. These included the right to collect taxes on behalf for the Temenggong, as well as for the welfare needs among the Chinese coolies living within the plot of land. The Kangchu generally granted tax exemption for the basic consumption by workers within the settlement. Some coolies took on new jobs such as shopkeepers and traders to serve the needs of other coolies within the settlement, and the Kangchu granted tax exemptions to these shopkeepers and traders on the sale of pork, opium and alcohol as well. The Kangchu reserved a portion of the land for the construction of a settlement for the coolies, from which small towns were formed and became the administrative centre of the Kangchu. These administrative centres were generally established within the coolie settlements located at the foot of the river, and were known as Kangkar (literally ""Foot of the river"", Chinese: æ¸¯è, Pinyin: GÃ¡ng JiÇo, Teochew: Kaang6 Caar8).[fn 4]


The Kangchu acted as the middleman in the bulk purchase of the settlement's commodities through suppliers based in Singapore. In particular, opium was highly popular among the coolies, although frowned upon by the British who took strong measures to suppress its distribution. The Kangchu formed illegal opium syndicates which had links to Chinese leaders from Singapore and other Malay states in the north, particularly Selangor. British contempt for the Kangchu was also fuelled by the coolies' preference for gambling and prostitution, both of which were seen as social vices by the British colonial government. The Kangchu maintained friendly relations with the Temenggong (later Sultan), and worked closely with the Ngee Heng Kongsi in administrative matters. In particular, the state government attempted to forge close relations with the Kangchu by the appointment of a Malay official who was conversant in Teochew and literate in Chinese characters, Mohamed Salleh bin Perang, as the liaison officer between the Temenggong and the Kangchu. Several years later, in the early 1870s, the state government worked closely with the Ngee Heng Kongsi to draft the Kanun Kangchu which had legal clauses that defined the powers of the Kangchu in Johor. The Kanun Kangchu contained 81 clauses in total, and was implemented in 1873.


Chinese settlers began migrating from the Riau Islands to Singapore in the 19th century shortly before the founding of Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819. The native Malays joined the Chinese in growing gambier, although they cultivated it for subsistence rather than for commercial purposes. The number of gambier and pepper farms expanded greatly between 1819 and 1840, fuelled by the increasing demand for gambier by Chinese traders from China as well as pepper by European traders. As land nearer to the town in the south was quickly used up in the 1820s, the Kangchu began to establish farms near the northern parts of Singapore, particularly stretches of land across the Straits of Johor from Jurong, to the west of Punggol in the northeast. By 1851, there were about 800 gambier and pepper farms which covered 75% of Singapore's land surface, of which 24,220 acres (98.0Â km2) was dedicated to gambier while 2,614 was dedicated to pepper.[fn 5]


In the 1850s and 1860s, many Kangchu abandoned their plantations in Singapore as gambier produce declined due to over farming of the soil, and began to establish new gambier and pepper plantations in neighbouring Johor. Nevertheless, many of these Kangchu settled down as merchants in Singapore and managed the gambier and pepper farms by proxy, mainly through the liaison body of the Ngee Heng Kongsi which had members in Singapore and Johor. Some of these merchants purchased the property rights of gambier and pepper farms from the Kangchu in Johor, who would then assume managerial tasks to ensure the smooth operation of the plantation and the settlement.[fn 6]


Unlike its counterpart in Johor, the Ngee Heng Kongsi (also called ""Ghi Hin Kongsi"" in Hokkien) was recognised as an illegal society in Singapore and its activities were actively suppressed by the colonial government. Factionalism appeared within the Ngee Heng Kongsi in Singapore by the 1850s, as business leaders from various dialect groups were unable to agree upon key issues. In particular, relations between the Teochews and Hokkiens were hostile, partly because some Hokkien merchants competed with the Teochew merchants in the gambier and pepper trade, most of whom had established their bases in the Boat Quay area along the Singapore River.


The existence of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British colonial government, even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their counterparts in Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to their counterparts in Johor, as the British colonial government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were wary of the fact that many Kangchu in Singapore were members of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee the social and economic affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.


The first gambier and pepper plantations appeared in the Riau Islands in the 1730s, after the Buginese warrior and second Yamtuan Muda of Riau, Daing Chelak, brought Chinese coolies from Malaya to Riau for the purpose of gambier cultivation, which was then widely used for medication among the locals. Another exodus of Chinese migrated to Riau in 1740 following unrest which erupted in Batavia, during which many Chinese were massacred. Chinese settlement in Riau continued into the 18th century, the majority of them coming from the Chaoshan area in Guangdong province, along with a sizeable minority from the southern parts of Fujian province.


Gambier and pepper farming were mainly confined to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct the operations of the plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese settlers and merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.


The first Chinese immigrants settled along the coastal regions of  Sarawak in significant numbers from the 18th century onwards and were engaged in the metal mining industry, mainly for gold and bauxite. As the supply of gold became exhausted from the 1820s onwards, the Chinese miners gradually turned to trade and agriculture. The Chinese of Teochew and Hakka heritage established gambier and pepper plantations in the 1870s and 1880s, and the White Rajah of Sarawak began to organise an administrative system for these plantations similar to the Kangchu system in Johor. The Kangchu of each plantation was appointed by the Charles Brooke, the then-White Rajah. Each Kangchu was given responsibilities to oversee the operations of the plantations under his jurisdiction and the welfare of the coolies living there. In 1875, the British promulgated a set of laws which defined the roles and responsibilities of the Kangchu; they were modelled very closely to the Kanun Kangchu that was introduced by Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor in 1873.


Charles Brooke encouraged the immigration of the Chinese coolies, beginning in the 1860s, to expand the state's gambier and pepper industry. Chinese settlers in neighbouring Sabah and Pontianak also established gambier and pepper plantations, although they existed as independent fiefdoms. These plantations rose to become one of the state's major industries as worldwide prices for gambier went up during the 1880s and 1890s. In the 20th century, as worldwide gambier prices took a dive, the Kangchu channelled their efforts into pepper and opium cultivation in the state. Sarawak's Kangchu system fell into obscurity in the 1920s, as the opium trade with Hong Kong steadily declined during the course of the decade.


The Kangchu system facilitated the growth of the gambier and pepper plantations and developed Johor's and Singapore's economies in the 19th century. The development of Johor's inland towns were attributed to the efforts by the various Kangchu, who were responsible for drawing the settlement plan for the coolies living within the plantation they were working on, from which new towns were formed. The Chinese immigrant population in Johor and Singapore grew in size during this period; Riau also experienced a similar growth during the 18th century. As a result of mass immigration by the Chinese into Johor, the Chinese quickly outnumbered the Malays in the state, although many Chinese coolies relocated to Singapore or other parts of Malaya as the gambier and pepper industry declined in the 20th century.[fn 7] Several towns and other places in Johor and Singapore, built upon sites of former gambier and pepper plantations, are named after former features of the Kangchu system, and are largely populated by ethnic Chinese.


The Teochew dialect became the lingua franca among the Chinese in many parts of Johor and Riau, as the majority of the Chinese from these areas were of Teochew origin, many of whom were descended from the Chinese coolies who had worked in the gambier and pepper plantations. The Teochews form the second-largest dialect group among Chinese Singaporeans, and many families can trace their family ancestry to immigrants who were Kangchu or coolies in these plantations.",1,29 July 2007, 7 September 2021,251,4,2

It is based on Slaughter's 2012 article Why Women Still Can't Have It All published in The Atlantic. Why Women Still Can't Have It All is one of the most widely read pieces in the Atlantic's history, with over 3 million views.


A look into the challenges of career advancement for professional women with children and the ""unfinished business"" of the women's movement. Drawing on her own experiences as a mother and State Department official, Slaughter argues for the importance of valuing care: the work to nurture our friends, family and loved ones. Unfinished Business challenges key arguments in Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook.


The book argues that a number of challenges remain for the women's movement in the US. It allows her to expands on her position in the article and respond to her critics. In Unfinished Business, she attempts to create a framework to understand the problems faced by all working parents, not just women. She also discusses US public policy and declares that without paid maternity leave, affordable childcare, the right to part-time work, job security for pregnant employees and better enforcement of discriminatory laws both men and women will continue to suffer. Slaughter urges a focus on the value of work being done, not on the traditional gender roles. She states that western notions of masculinity should be challenged before women imprison men to the crippling gender roles women have been fighting to escape from. Slaughter believes that men and women must acknowledge the damaging social system in place hindering their ability to make money while simultaneously caring for their families. When this system is realized they must work together to push the boundaries of traditional gender roles and create an impactful, positive change. Ultimately, Slaughter calls for a change in the workplace policies which affect both men and women. She argues that embracing a parental role, instead of a gendered one is crucial for the success of future families. One step toward gender equity that it advocates is empowering men to re-envision their lives and embrace the roles of engaged fathers, sons and caregivers.


Unfinished Business has been widely reviewed in the US and UK. Jill Abramson, former executive editor of the New York Times, reviewed the book for the Washington Post, writing, ""Slaughter's case for revaluing and better compensating caregiving is compelling. . . . Slaughter makes it a point in her book to speak beyond the elite...sheâs right that there is something fundamentally wrong with a society that values managing money so much more than raising children well."" The Economist wrote ""Ms Slaughter has widened her conceptual lens in response to her critics. Whereas the Atlantic article was written ""for my demographic [of] highly educated, well-off women who are privileged enough to have choices in the first place"", Unfinished Business is full of voices from outside her social group.""


The journal Signs devoted an online feature and the Winter 2017 issue to discussing the book, including nine responses from scholars and thinkers including Joan C Williams and Ai-Jen Poo.  ""Slaughterâs book is a pleasure to read, as is having her very considerable powers focused on work-family conflict. I fervently hope her focus on building a broad coalition and using a broad range of change levers will help her generation accomplish more than mine did. God knows we need it,"" Joan Williams wrote in her response. Premilla Nadasen wrote:  ""Slaughterâs most important contribution is to reclaim care work as valuable. She argues that care is a universal issue that connects people across class and race lines, and that it includes not just child care but care for disabled adults and the elderly. Revaluing care, Slaughter argues, means changing the way we think, transforming our workplaces, and offering both better pay to care workers and government support for family-friendly policies.""",0,29 September 2015, 4 August 2021,54,0,0

3234155,University Pitt Club,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Pitt_Club,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_Pitt_Club&action=info,"The University Pitt Club, popularly referred to as the Pitt Club, the UPC, or merely as Club, is a private members' club of the University of Cambridge, with a previously male-only membership but now open to both men and women.


The Pitt Club was founded in Michaelmas term 1835 named in honour of Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, who had been a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge. It was originally intended as one of the Pitt Clubs, a series political clubs set up across Great Britain, 'to do honour to the name and memory of Mr William Pitt, to uphold in general the political principles for which he stood'. In particular the University Pitt Club was intended 'to assist the local party organisations of the town of Cambridge to return worthy, that is to say, Tory, representatives to Parliament and to the Borough Council'.  From the start, however, there was a social element as the Club's political events were combined with 'the pleasures of social intercourse at dinner, when party fervour among friends, dining in party uniform, might be warmed towards a political incandescence by the speeches to successive toasts'.


Over the course of the Pitt Club's first few decades, the political element diminished whilst the social element increased.  By '1868, at the latest, the Pitt Club [had] ceased from all political activity and . . . elected members to its social advantages without any regards whatever to considerations of political party'. Though the Club's raison d'Ãªtre changed in its early years, it 'was from the first, and has always remained, an undergraduate organization'.
The Pitt Club has been in almost continuous operation since its founding.  During the First World War, however, the Club's existence became increasingly tenuous as more Cambridge men joined the forces.  It temporarily closed in October 1917 but reopened in early 1919.  By 1920, the Club had 'become nearly normal again, ""the only real trouble"", according to the Minutes, ""being the horrible scarcity of whisky'"".


The premises were commandeered during the Second World War and made available to the public.  One observer, A. S. F. Gow, remarked at the time that the Pitt Club's 'eponymous hero looks down from the pediment, with a nose visibly tiptilted in disgust, upon an enormous notice displaying the legend ""British Restaurant""'. As for the members, they were forced to seek alternative accommodation and eventually settled for temporary rooms above the post office in Trinity Street, which they called the Interim Club.


On 7 November 2017, a referendum to elect women into the club passed. This did not pass without controversy though, with only resident members being granted a vote.


The Club was a peripatetic organisation during its first few years, meeting variously in the rooms of members and in other venues.  In 1841, it acquired rooms over the shop of Mr Richard Hutt, bookseller, at 29 Trinity Street, which it occupied until 1843.  From 1843 until 1866, the Pitt Club's rooms were located over the furniture shop of a Mr Metcalfe at 74 Bridge Street, on the corner of All Saints' Passage.


Since 1866, the Club's premises have been at 7a Jesus Lane.  The building was originally designed in 1863 as Victorian Roman Baths by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt. The baths were an extremely short-lived venture, opening in late February 1863 and closing by December of that year. After the closure, a liquidation sale ensued, and the building was auctioned off in 1865, being bought by its own architect, Wyatt, for Â£2,700. He rented out half of the building to the Pitt Club, and the other half to Orme's Billiards Rooms.


In 1907, the Club bought the entire building.  Following a fire in the same year, the interior of the Club was extensively renovated. There were further renovations in 1925, and the dining room was paneled in 1927.


The large plaque of Pitt's head that adorns the pediment over the entrance to the Club was presented in February 1933 by General Sir Neill Malcolm.  It had formerly been on a wall at Bowling-Green House in Putney, Pitt's place of death, which was pulled down in 1932.


For most of the century after its purchase of 7a Jesus Lane, the Club occupied the whole of the prominent neo-classical building.  The clubhouse was designated a Grade II listed building in 1950. As the Club went through mounting financial difficulties in the 1990s, it sold a 25-year leasehold on the ground floor of its building to the Pizza Express chain in October 1997, although the ground floor had been in use as a restaurant (once known as Xanadu), since at least 1985. The Club now occupies the first floor of the building.

In a 1989 NPR interview, Blane said the song was inspired by a picture of a trolleycar in a turn-of-the-century newspaper. In 1974, he had said that the picture was in a book he'd found at the Beverly Hills Public Library and was captioned ""'Clang, Clang, Clang,' Went the Trolley.""


Blane and Martin were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 1945 Academy Awards, for ""The Trolley Song"" but lost to ""Swinging on a Star"" from Going My Way. ""The Trolley Song"" was ranked #26 by the American Film Institute in 2004 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs list. The song as conducted by Georgie Stoll for Meet Me in St. Louis has a very complex, evocative arrangement by Conrad Salinger featuring harmonized choruses, wordless vocals, and short highlights or flourishes from a wide range of orchestral instruments.


It has been claimed for years that when the song was recorded on the set of Meet Me in St Louis, it was done in a single shot,[citation needed] and also that Garland accidentally repeated a verse instead of singing the next verse, but songs in Hollywood musicals of that era were not recorded on set. They were prerecorded in a studio and lip-synched by the artists, and the number in the film consists of far more than one shot, and there is no repeated verse in the film.",3,19 July 2007, 24 August 2021,148,0,0

The film was made during the Second World War, and the action is set in a small town in German-occupied France. It portrays the activities of members of the French Resistance and the Germans' tactic of taking and shooting innocent hostages in reprisal for acts of sabotage. The opening credits acknowledge ""the official co-operation of General de Gaulle and the French National Committee"".


Dorothy Hope is credited with ""original story"".


A young French idealist (John Clements), who gives his name as Jean Baptiste, arrives in ""St Pierre-le-Port"", a small town near Saint-Nazaire, a major port and base of operations for the German Navy, particularly their U-boats, on the Atlantic coast. Baptiste tells a member of the French Resistance that ""I come from Saint-Nazaire. I've details of the submarine base, the docks and power plant. If I can get them to England...""


The first half of the film often has a lighthearted tone; the Germans are portrayed as bumbling and easily outwitted. The German commandant is overweight and gullible.  However, after the Resistance successfully sabotages a German armaments train, the SS take charge of the town, and the occupation takes a brutal turn.


Nicholas Brodzsky is credited for the music, while the orchestration is credited to Roy Douglas, an English composer who was much in demand as an arranger, orchestrator, and copyist of the music of others, notably Richard Addinsell, Ralph Vaughan Williams and William Walton. However it is possible that Brodzsky actually contributed very little. In a memoir in the William Walton Archive, Roy Douglas claimed, ""Brodsky was a so-called composer: I had actually composed entire film scores for him, which went under his name"". In a letter to Roy Douglas dated 23 December 1943, William Walton wrote, ""I'm delighted about your picture. I'll have a good deal to tell you about Brodsky when I see you. In my capacity as music adviser to Two Cities [a film company] it is going to be my duty to have to tick him off!""",0,22 August 2008, 15 August 2021,62,0,0

However, its provenance is uncertain, and even its identity as a headdress has been questioned. It is made of quetzal and other feathers with sewn-on gold detailing. It is now in the Weltmuseum Wien, and is a source of dispute between Austria and Mexico, as no similar pieces remain in Mexico. Restoration efforts reignited this dispute in 2012.


The feathers of the piece have deteriorated over the centuries. It is 116Â cm (46Â in) high and 175Â cm (69Â in) across and has the form of concentric layers of different colored feathers arranged in a semicircle. The smallest is made from blue feathers of the Cotinga amabilis (xiuhtÅtÅtl) with small plates of gold in the shapes of half moons. Behind this is a layer of Roseate spoonbill (tlÄuhquechÅlli) feathers, then small quetzal feathers, then a layer of white-tipped red-brown feathers of the squirrel cuckoo, Piaya cayana, with three bands of small gold plates, and finally two of 400 closely spaced quetzal tail feathers, some 55Â cm (22Â in) long. The quetzal feathers in the center of the headdress are raised relative to the sides. Leather straps attach the crown to the head of the wearer.


Although attributed to Moctezuma and the Spanish conquest, the provenance of the piece is unattested, and it does not match Aztec illustrations of the headdress of their nobility. It became an object of interest to European researchers such as Ferdinand von Hochstetter and Eduard Seler at the end of the 19th century, and its identification as a quetzalapanecayotl is attributed to American anthropologist Zelia Nuttall. It was restored in 1878, while still thought to be a mantle rather than a headdress. It is attested since 1575 in the collections of Archduke Ferdinand in Ambras near Innsbruck, Austria. At the beginning of the 19th century it was deposited in the Museum of Ethnology (inventory number 10402VO) in Vienna along with other liturgical artifacts of Quetzalcoatl and Ehecatl.",0,19 August 2009, 23 March 2021,99,0,0

8986955,Siege of Bursa,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Bursa,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Bursa&action=info,"The siege of Prusa occurred from 1317 until the capture on 6 April 1326, when the Ottomans deployed a bold plan to seize Prusa (modern-day Bursa, Turkey). The Ottomans had not captured a city before; the lack of expertise and adequate siege equipment at this stage of the war meant that the city fell only after six or nine years.


The historian, Laonikos Chalkokondyles, notes that the Ottomans took advantage of the Byzantine civil war of 1321â1328 to capture the city: ""Andronikos decided that he should hold the throne himself, as his grandfather had already grown old, and so they fell out with each other. He was too stubborn to submit and caused endless trouble. He brought in the Serbs and allied himself with the leading Greeks in his struggle for the throne. As a result they could do nothing to prevent the Turks from crossing over into Europe. It was at this time that Prusa was besieged, starved out, and taken by Osman, and other cities in Asia were captured.""


According to some sources Osman I died of natural causes just before the fall of the city, while others suggest that he lived long enough to hear about the victory on his death-bed and was buried in Bursa afterwards.


After the fall of the city, his son and successor Orhan made Bursa the first official Ottoman capital and it remained so until 1366, when Edirne became the new capital. As a result, Bursa holds a special place in Ottoman history as their founding city, and also as the birthplace of Ottoman architecture (Bursa Grand Mosque (1399), Bayezid I Mosque (1395), HÃ¼davendigar Mosque (1385), and YeÅil Mosque) (1421). During his reign Orhan encouraged urban growth through the construction of buildings such as imarets, Turkish baths, mosques, inns and caravanserais, and he also built a mosque and a medrese in what is now known as the Hisar district, and after his death was buried there in his tÃ¼rbe (mausoleum) next to his father. The Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta who visited Bursa in 1331 was impressed by the sultan and found Bursa an enjoyable city ""with fine bazaars and wide streets, surrounded on all sides by gardens and running springs.""


Paul K. Davis writes, ""The capture of Bursa established Osman I (Othman) and his successors as the major power in Asia Minor, beginning the Ottoman Empire.""

He has twice represented Kenya at the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and won a team gold medal in 2016. His half marathon personal best is 59:20 minutes, set in 2013, which ranks him in the top 40 of all time.


Cheprot first emerged as a distance runner on the American road circuit in 2009, winning a series of low level races. The following year he had top eight finishes at high level races, including the Lilac Bloomsday Run, Bolder Boulder and Cooper River Bridge Run. He began competing in Europe in the 2011 season and made his debut in the half marathon, taking third place at both the San Blas Half Marathon and Azkoitia-Azpeitia Half Marathon. He achieved a time of 61:59 minutes at the latter race, heading towards elite standard. He tried his hand at marathon running in 2013, but failed to finish in either Venice or Verona. His shorter distance rimes improved however, going under 28 minutes for the 10K run for the first time and setting a half marathon best of 61:07 minutes at the Route du Vin Half Marathon â the 10K time ranked in the world's top forty for the year.


Cheprot made a breakthrough at the 2013 Roma-Ostia Half Marathon, finishing third behind world champion Wilson Kiprop with a time of 59:20 minutes. This moved him to seventh in that year's rankings. Better results did not materialise late rin the year, however, as he failed to complete the Rome City Marathon and was three minutes slower than his best at the Portugal Half Marathon, coming sixth. A fourth-place finish at the 2014 Roma-Ostia earned him his first international call-up and at the 2014 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships he placed 22nd overall. He also managed a 10K best at the Prague Grand Prix that year, recording a time of 27:41 minutes which again ranked him in the world's top ten for the season.


Cheprot performed consistently in the 2015 season. He was runner-up in Roma-Ostia with a time of 59:39 minutes, then was runner-up at the Ottawa 10K and won the Corrida de Langueux. All five of his half marathon outings that year brought times close to the one hour mark â his best of 59:32 minutes for fourth at the Copenhagen Half Marathon put him at twelfth place on the 2015 world lists.


He was chosen for the Kenyan team at the 2016 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and earned his first global medal as his sixth-place finish helped the Kenyan trio of Cheprot, Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor and Bedan Karoki Muchiri to record a sub-3-hour time for the team gold medals.",1,29 March 2016, 27 April 2021,7,0,0

It is located at a distance of 28Â km south of Mysuru (connected by State Highway via Varuna village) and around 170Â km from Bengaluru. The shrine of Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivrathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji is the main temple at Suttur. Thousands of devotees visit the shrine throughout the year.


Community life in India is closely linked with spiritual and religious institutions for the past five thousand years. The Rishis have been the beacons and guiding forces in upholding the moral values of life and in the progression of society as a whole. The glorious Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Math, popularly known as  Sri Suttur Math is a reflection of and testimony to this rich tradition.
Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math with a long history of more than one thousand years is a multi-dimensional institution that has contributed immensely to the cause of societal advancement. The welfare activities of the Math transcend the public of all the sections of Indian society. The founding of the Math can be traced to a historical event linked with Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji crusading for peace between two warring kingdoms. The hostility between Rachamalla IV of the Gangas of Talkad and Rajendra of Cholas was about to break up into a large scale war. It was due to the timely intervention of Sri Shivarathreeshwara Swamigalu, the hostility ended and the enemies became friends. Then it was at the request of Rajendra, Mahaswamiji graciously condescended to establish a Math on the banks of the River Kapila at Suttur near Mysuru.


The inscriptional pieces of evidence support the establishment of Suttur Math during the reign of Chola kingdom. The name Shivarathri is mentioned in many ancient works. The Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji tradition handed down from one pontiff to another indicates that the said Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji  is the founder of the Jagadguru Sri Veersimhasana Math.
Sri Eshaneshwara Wodeyar, the second pontiff, was responsible for further development of the Suttur Math during the times of Rajendra Chola. The Someshwara temple near the Math at Suttur is said to have been constructed by the Chola kings, in accordance with the wishes of Sri Eshaneshwara Wodeyar. An inscription referring to this event is dated October 23, 1032.


Suttur Mutt has a history of 1,000 years. Suttur Mutt established Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeswara Mahavidyapeetha (popularly called as JSS Mahavidyapeetha) in 1954. Suttur Mutt runs more than 300 educational institutions in Karnataka and other parts of the country. Some of the institutions are located in North India and outside the country. The present Pontiff Jagadguru Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji is the President of Mahavidyapeetha.
Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math can most aptly be described as an active ongoing movement to uphold the cause of social and economic justice, based on spiritual values and ideals. The Math's activities at Suttur have spread far and wide beyond the small region on the banks of the River Kapila in Karnataka to touch the lives of millions going beyond the boundaries of our country, and even to the distant shores of the other countries.
A quick look at the lineage of the Math brings to light the unwavering societal concern of the Pontiffs. If the founding of the Math was incidental to establishing harmony and peace between the two warring factions of the region by its founder, Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji, the Pontiffs who followed saw purpose in promoting academics, literature, healthcare, infrastructure, etc.
The Math philosophy has found expression in the teachings and words of countless saints and seers as well as writers and philosophers. The worship of Shiva means 'tolerance and love to all living beings' and 'regarding work as a means of worship'.
â
The lineage of Suttur Math
The Suttur Math region grew up over the centuries with the contribution of each one of its illustrious pontiffs. Each pontiff chose his route to further the advancement of society. The high stature that the Sri Suttur Math enjoys today is thus the cumulative result of their initiatives, efforts and actions.

2656307,Too Much Pressure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Much_Pressure,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Too_Much_Pressure&action=info,"Too Much Pressure is the first album by British ska band The Selecter. After the band's official formation in 1979 in Coventry, following the release of a song entitled ""The Selecter"" by an unofficial incarnation of the band, the band's hit single ""On My Radio"" prompted their labels 2 Tone and Chrysalis to ask the band to record their debut album. Working with producer Errol Ross, the Selecter recorded the album at Horizon Studios over two months. The album contains original material, mostly composed by band founder and guitarist Neol Davies, as well as numerous ska and reggae cover versions, in a similar fashion to the Specials' debut album.


The album was released in February 1980 on 2 Tone records. The record was commercially successful, charting at number 5 in the United Kingdom. The record's singles, ""Three Minute Hero"" and ""Missing Words"", made the top 25 of the UK Singles Chart. The album was also critically successful, and has had lasting praise in the ensuing years. Although the band's accompanying 2 On 2 Tour with several other 2 Tone acts was fraught with violence, it also helped achieve, in part, the album's commercial success. The band performed the album live for the first time as part of its 35th anniversary tour in 2014.


In 1977, Coventry-based musicians Neol Davies (guitar), Barry Jones (trombone) and John Bradbury (drums) recorded a rocksteady instrumental together named ""The Kingston Affair"". In 1979, when 2 Tone initiators The Specials, for which Bradbury had become drummer, had spent their entire recording budget (allegedly Â£700) for their debut single ""Gangsters"", the band were still requiring a B-side for the song, Bradbury suggested ""The Kingston Affair"", which at that point had remained unreleased; it became the song's B-side with the new name ""The Selecter"", and was credited to the band name The Selecter too.


""Gangsters"" had become a national hit by July 1979, and had prompted interest in The Selecter, so Davies chose to create an actual band with the name, with a sound similar to the Specials. One biography stated that, ""at the time Coventry had various reggae, punk and soul bands on the go, which proved to be rich pickings for anyone wishing to create the 2 Tone sound."" Davies recruited his friends keyboardist Desmond Brown and bassist Charley Anderson, and ""filled out the lineup with guitarist Compton Amanor, Charley 'H' Bembridge on drums, and vocalist Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson; when Davies met Pauline Black, he promptly gave her an audition, and she was added to the lineup as lead singer."" According to one biography,


""Pauline had made her way to Coventry via Lanchester Polytechnic where she was 'asked to leave' although she did gain employment as a radiographer in a local hospital. Pauline had performed with various local bands and adopted the stage name Pauline Black to avoid any awkward questions from her employers. She would also earn the title of the first 2 Tone pin up which she took in her stride but she was always keen to point out that the music should come first.""

After only a few weeks, the band had played live, both in Coventry and supporting the Specials in London, and signed to 2 Tone Records. Recording their first single, ""On My Radio"", on a Â£1,000 budget in Coventry's Horizon Studios with production from Roger Lomas, was the Selecter's first move. Backed with the B-side ""Too Much Pressure"", the single was an unprecedented success, reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1979, and ultimately selling almost 250,000 copies; ironically, although the song criticises radio's neglect of new music, it was a major radio success too. That same month, the band toured with Madness and the Specials as part of the first, sell-out ""2 Tone Tour;"" and all three bands debuted on Top of the Pops on 8 November 1979 playing their latest hits, ""leaving no one in any doubt that 2 Tone had well and truly arrived."" The band and 2 Tone were now regulars in the music press, and keen to lean in on the 2 Tone phenomenon, Chrysalis Records, the owner of 2 Tone Records, ""rushed the band"" into recording their debut album.


""Taking a folkie risk like their confreres the Specials, they honor their undercapitalized roots by emulating the two-track sound of the cult hits they love. Fortunately, Davies has an amazing ability to recapture the ska spirit without pretending it's 1965.""


âRobert Christgau


Too Much Pressure was recorded over two months from December 1979 to January 1980 in Horizon Studios, Coventry, the same place the band's debut single was recorded, with producer Errol Ross. Guest musicians Rico Rodriguez and Dick Cuthell of the Specials were drafted in to contribute the ""necessary brass sections"" to the album. Kim Templeman-Holmes engineered the sessions.


Too Much Pressure is largely a studio recording of The Selecter's live set list at the time, and while largely consisting of original material (mostly written by Davies), it also contains cover versions of numerous old ska and reggae tracks. This template is similar to the Specials' debut album Specials, which was based on that band's live set and featured ska and reggae covers among its many original songs. The 2-tone.info article on the band, comparing the cover versions on Too Much Pressure to those on Specials, felt that ""The Selecter were somewhat less obvious in their choice of covers and opted for the likes of Justin Hinds' 'Carry Go Bring Come' and The Pioneers' 'Time Hard'."" Two cover versions from the band's live sets which were not recorded for the record, ""Train to Skaville"" by The Ethiopians and ""Soulful I"" by The Upsetters, were later recorded by the band following their departure from 2 Tone Records. The band also played a cover version of Prince Buster's ""Madness"", but this also did not make the album.


Overall, the album is tense and trebly, and displays a mix of punk rock, ska and reggae with raw vocals and politically conscious lyrics. The album's ska beats and ""distinctive bouncy organ"" contribute to the album's musical impact. According to Trouser Press, although Davies composed the majority of the album, the record's ""contributions from other sources â within and without the lineup â add further variety."" The magazine stated that the playing ""hops along,"" especially with the sporadic horn section, and wrote that it is Black, ""shining with enormous vocal talent,"" who ""continually provides the spark."" Black later recalled that she was happy with the two songs she contributed, ""Black and Blue"" and ""They Make Me Mad."" The album's title song directly references ""what was going on socially at that time,"" while ""They Make Me Mad"" attacks ""the divisive rhetoric of the privileged.""


Although Too Much Pressure was slated for release on 14 February 1980, St. Valentine's Day, it was in fact released on 23 February 1980 by 2 Tone Records and Chrysalis Records. With the help of the 2 One 2 Tour, and the album's singles, Too Much Pressure ultimately reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart, the band's highest peak on the chart to date, and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The album was later certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 100,000. In the United States, where the album was released by Chrysalis alone, ""On My Radio"" was added as the first track. The album cover design is credited to ""Teflon"" Sims and David Storey, with photography by Rick Mann, and depicts Steve Eaton.


""Three Minute Hero"" was released as the first single from the album prior to the album's release so it could act ""as a teaser of what to come."" However, at the time, it was treated indifferently by music critics, and peaking at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, it matched Madness' ""The Prince"" as the lowest chart position at that point reached by a 2 Tone single. The record was then surpassed by the album's second single, ""Missing Words"", remixed for the single release by Roger Lomas with a live rendition of ""Carry Go Bring Home"" on the B-side, only reached number 23 on the charts; however, both singles were still seen as successes. According to one author, ""the chart position was no reflection on the work of Roger Lomas, who prior to 2 Tone had no experience with ska but had since went [sic] on to work with Bad Manners and The Bodysnatchers, but was perhaps a sign of things to come for the band and 2 Tone.""


To promote the record, 2 Tone Records organized the ""2 One 2 Tour"" tour for the Selecter, the Beat and the Bodysnatchers, the latter band of which was the latest singing by the label. However, the Beat opted out, as they could not focus on the tour having just started Go-Feet Records. American band Holly and the Italians replaced the Beat, but they were poorly received by audiences and were replaced by future 2-Tone signees The Swinging Cats after some time.


During the tour, the band witnessed the racism and violence that had started to become more prominent in audiences for 2 Tone performances; 2-tone.info states that ""there was matter of racists attending the gigs. Like all bands on 2 Tone, The Selecter had their share of 'fans' who had rightwing sympathies and would make their presence known at gigs. Why racists would listen to ska or reggae is a mystery in itself and is all the more bizarre that they should attend a Selecter gig where, of the 7 members of the band, only Neol Davis was white."" Although the crowd was often indifferent to Holly and the Italians, several audience members took great exception to the group, whose pop punk sound differed greatly from 2 Tone, and would incite violence.


As was also the case for the Specials, Chrysalis, 2-Tone's parent company, were hoping to give the band some success in the United States, organising a coast-to-coast tour, preceding with a re-release of ""On My Radio"". However, audiences were mostly unaware of the band; and Black later stated ""There were small groups of people on the west and east coast who knew who we were but there was this huge big bit in the middle [of the US] who were completely gob-smacked by us"". The tour ""did little to expand the bands [sic] popularity in the US and they were to suffer the same fait [sic] as The Specials, with their material confined to the college radio circuit.""


Critical reception to Too Much Pressure was positive. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice awarded the album a score of ""Aâ"". He commented how, ""except for songwriter-guitarist Neol Davies, these two-toners are black, reassuring in a movement that calls up fears of folkie patronization. Lead singer's a woman, too, a refreshing piece of progress no matter how self-consciously progressive its motives."" He advised listeners to ""play loud."" Red Starr of Smash Hits rated the album seven out of ten. He felt that, while most of the strongest tracks are cover versions, the album relies on its ska beat, bouncy organ and Black's vocals to provide the impact, and called the album a ""very healthy debut with plenty of life."" Garry Bushell of Sounds rated the album five stars out of five, noting the vitality of the album and complimenting the catchiness of ""Three Minute Hero.""


In a retrospective review, Allmusic highlighted the album as an ""Album Pick"" and rated it four stars out of five. Trouser Press singled out Black as ""continually [providing] the spark"" and stated the album is ""bursting with great songs."" Louder Than War referred to the album as an ""iconic"" and ""seminal debut album."" In the Spin Alternative Record Guide, it is commented that, although the album contained ""requisite cover tunes,"" the album was ""much more celebrated for unorthodox originals like 'Three Minute Hero' and 'My Collie (Not a Dog)'."" In The Great Rock Discography, Martin C. Strong called the album an ""effervescent companion piece to The Specials' more radical debut"" and singling out the cover versions as the best tracks. Helen G of The F-Word praised the album for ""having everything,"" complimenting the ""heady brew of punk, ska and reggae music, politically conscious lyrics and the raw, passionate vocals.""


The album has featured in several critics' lists; Robert Christgau, in his ""Dean's List"" of the year's best albums, a list curated for the annual Pazz & Jop poll, named the album the 60th best of 1980.  Music journalist Simon Reynolds lists it as one of the five most important albums of ""2-Tone and the Ska Resurrection"" in his 2005 book Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978â1984.


Following the release of the album, Black became dubbed the ""Queen of British Ska."" Helen G of The F-Word considers Black's contributions to the album to be the first notable example of a woman ""working in the reggae idiom"" during the punk scene. The Selecter were the only band aside from the Specials to record a full album for 2 Tone Records, as many of its artists only released one single on the label; Black, speaking to Spin magazine in 2009, recalled: ""We didn't just do one single, we did an album, we did tours. Is that a point of pride? Yeah, absolutely. We believed in it. And I think we fully embodied the whole ethos of 2 Tone much more maybe than some of the other bands. For a start, there were six black people, one white person, and a female in the band."" A poster for the album was known to hang in Chrysalis' head offices for a long time following its release. The Selecter explored similar themes to Too Much Pressure on their 12th studio album Made in Britain (2012), which contains a re-recording of ""They Make Me Mad"", whose lyrics were said by Helen G to ""remain relevant"" in 2012. ""Too Much Pressure"" featured in the film The Abyss (1989).


Despite the critical and commercial success of Too Much Pressure, the aftermath of its release was fraught with problems for the band. Their relationship with 2 Tone Records was disintegrating, who were publishing merchandise without the band's consent (Davies once commented: ""There is a hell of a lot of money being made, supposedly in our names, but where's it all going?""), and also felt ""there were not enough avenues for them to broaden their musical horizons again this was due to the huge success of 2 Tone."" The band left the label and signed a direct deal with its parent label Chrysalis to record their more eclectic second album Celebrate the Bullet (1981), but not before Brown and Anderson left the band, with replacements in the band personnel therefore being made.


The Selecter were also unsatisfied with the production of Too Much Pressure, considering the album to be the product of what Black recalled was ""a life-span [...] telescoped down into a very short space of time"". In her autobiography Black by Design, Black said Ross ""somehow wrecked"" the album, and said it would have ""sounded better"" had it been produced by Lomas instead: ""I thought that it was very unfortunate that the man who had produced 'On My Radio' as our first single didnât get the chance to produce the first album. But that was due to political fighting in the band, and a question who had control of it and who didnât. But thatâs all water under the bridge."" However, Black remains happy with the album's themes, reflecting in 2016 that the Selecter's intents never changed in the ensuing years ""because no tectonic plates have really moved as far as weâre concerned. Maybe theyâve moved in other areas. But as far as that whole black-white thing going on in society, those tectonic plates have moved but there hasnât been any real seismic kind of alleviation of the pressure. Itâs too much pressure then, and itâs still too much pressure now.â


""We thought our 35th anniversary would be the perfect time to revisit our very first album Too Much Pressure and perform it in fullâ¦for the very first time! We canât wait to get on the road to bring our message of multiculturalism from across 4 decades to venues up and down the land.""


âPauline Black, speaking prior to the 35th anniversary tour.


Too Much Pressure has been re-released several times; in 1988, Chrysalis re-released the LP in Germany, and Captain Mod has remastered and re-released the album on CD twice, on 18 June 2001 and 19 May 2014, both times with three bonus tracks: ""The Selecter"", ""On My Radio"" and the single version of ""Too Much Pressure."" Re-issue label Obscure Alternatives have also re-released the album on LP in the United States in both 2012 and 2016; the 2012 edition was pressed variantly on black and grey vinyl, whilst the 2016 edition, which was limited to 589 copies, features a white vinyl with black effects and markings.


From FebruaryâApril 2014, the band celebrated the album's 35th anniversary with the national ""Too Much Pressure 35th Anniversary Tour,"" where, for the first time, they played the album in its entirety. In addition to performing the full record, the group also played ""an extended encore of hits and live favourites from across The Selecterâs extensive 35-year spanning back catalogue,"" including ""On My Radio"" and material from their latest, critically successful album String Theory (2013). The tour was well-received by such publications as Gentlemen's Quarterly and Rock City.


All tracks composed by Neol Davies except where noted.

The team played their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan. They were coached by Tom Izzo, in his fifth year as head coach, and were members of the Big Ten Conference. The Spartans finished the season 32â7, 13â3 to win a share of the Big Ten regular season championship for the third consecutive year. As the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, they defeated Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois to win the tournament championship for the second consecutive year. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. As the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region, they defeated Valparaiso and Utah to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the third consecutive year. They then defeated Syracuse and Iowa State to advance to the Final Four for the second consecutive year. After a win in the National Semifinal over fellow Big Ten foe Wisconsin, MSU won the National Championship over Florida. The win marked the school's second National Championship and Izzo's only championship to date.


The Spartans finished the 1998â99 season with an overall record of 33â5, 15â1 to finish in first place in Big Ten play. Michigan State received a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, their second consecutive trip to the Tournament, and advanced to the Final Four, their first trip to the Final Four under Tom Izzo.


The Spartans were looking to build on their Final Four appearance the year before with seniors, Mateen Cleaves (12.1 points and 6.9 assist per game) and Morris Peterson (16.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game), leading the way. MSU began the season ranked No. 3 in the country, but were without starting point guard and team captain, Cleaves, who sustained a stress fracture in his right foot during the offseason.


Without Cleaves, the Spartans began the season with a home win over Toledo before travelling to Puerto Rico for the Puerto Rico Shootout. In Puerto Rico, they defeated Providence and South Carolina to advance to the championship of the tournament. In the championship game, they lost to No. 20 Texas. The Spartans went on to defeat No. 2 North Carolina on the road as part of the inaugural ACCâBig Ten Challenge. MSU returned to East Lansing for easy wins over Howard and Eastern Michigan. A win over No. 5-ranked Kansas in the Great Eight in Chicago followed. A road loss to No. 2 Arizona followed the neutral court win over Kansas.  MSU sandwiched home wins over Oakland and Mississippi Valley State around a loss on the road to unranked Kentucky. A shocking loss on the road at Wright State added to the early season struggles and ended the non-conference slate. MSU would enter the Big Ten schedule at 9â4 and ranked No. 11 in the country.


Cleaves returned to the Spartans lineup on January 5, 2000 to help the Spartans to wins over Penn State and Iowa.  Led by Cleaves the Spartans defeated No. 9 Indiana before losing their first Big Ten game on the road to No. 7 Ohio State. The loss stopped MSU's 21-game conference winning streak dating back to 1999. The Spartans bounced back with wins over Northwestern in back-to-back games, holding Northwestern to 29 points in the second game.  A win over Illinois led by Charlie Bell's 20 points led to a matchup against rival Michigan with the Spartans at 15â5, 6â1 on the season.  In Ann Arbor, MSU blew out the Wolverines as Michigan was without leading scorer Jamal Crawford who was declared ineligible 20 minutes before the game started because of NCAA investigations. Led by Morris Peterson's 32 points and 10 points, MSU had no problems with Michigan especially without their leading scorer, winning by 20. MSU then stepped out of conference for a matchup with No. 7 Connecticut, a fellow participant in the prior year's Final Four. The Spartans had no problems with the Huskies, scoring 25 second chance points and 20 points off Huskie turnovers. MSU returned to the Big Ten to face Purdue in West Lafayette and were upset, falling 70â67. The loss dropped the Spartans to 17â6, 7â2. The Spartans would rebound to beat Wisconsin in Madison before beating No. 7 Ohio State to avenge their earlier loss. A close win over Wisconsin in East Lansing marked their 26th straight win in the Breslin Center and pushed the Spartans to 10â2 in conference. A road win over Penn State preceded an overtime road loss to Indiana. MSU returned home and blew out Minnesota 79â43. In the final regular season game of the season, the Spartans faced Michigan. Cleaves dished out 20 assists as he set the Big Ten career record for assists in the 114â63 thumping of the Wolverines.


The Spartans finished the conference slate with a 13â3 conference record and 23â7 overall while being ranked No. 2 in the country. MSU earned a share of the Big Ten regular season title with Ohio State, their third consecutive championship.


The Spartans went on to win the third annual Big Ten Tournament as the No. 2 seed, defeating No. 25 Illinois for the championship for the second consecutive year. Cleaves and Peterson were named to the AllâTournament Team and Peterson was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.


As a result of their strong finish, the Spartans were awarded the No. 1 seed, their second consecutive No. 1 seed, in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. From there, the Spartans cruised to their third consecutive Sweet Sixteen with wins over Valparaiso, and Utah. MSU continued their National Championship push by reaching their second consecutive Final Four with wins over Syracuse and Iowa State. MSU won every game by double digits despite playing the best possible seed in each round.

It is located immediately across the river from the downtown core and the river valley neighbourhood of Riverdale.  Southside neighbourhoods overlooking Cloverdale include: Bonnie Doon, Strathearn, Holyrood, and Forest Heights.  The southwest corner of the neighbourhood is bounded by Connor's Road, the approaches to the Low Level Bridge, and the mouth of the Mill Creek Ravine.  The Low Level Bridge and James McDonald Bridge connect the neighbourhood to the north side, while Scona Road provides access to Old Strathcona.


The Muttart Conservatoryâa botanical garden consisting of four glass, pyramid-shaped structures that showcase plants from arid, tropical, and temperate climatesâis located in the Cloverdale neighbourhood.


Gallagher Park, where the Edmonton Folk Music Festival is held every August, is also located in Cloverdale.
Cloverdale is also home to Edmonton's oldest ski hill, The Edmonton Ski Club.


The community is represented by the Cloverdale Community League, established in 1920, which maintains a community hall and outdoor rink located at 94 Street and 97 Avenue.


In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Cloverdale had a population of 885 living in 476 dwellings, an 8.7% change from its 2009 population of 814. With a land area of 19.28Â km2 (7.44Â sqÂ mi), it had a population density of 45.9 people/km2 in 2012.


Early residential development in the area consisted of working-class homes for the men working at the numerous commercial and industrial sites in Gallagher Flats (as the area was then known) in the early 1900s. The population was such that when a new, two-classroom school was planned in 1912, it was expanded to four classrooms before being finished in 1913. Redevelopment of the neighbourhood since 1984 has seen the replacement of much of the early housing with much larger and more modern homes.


According to the 2001 federal census, one residence in five (18.4%) were constructed before 1946.  Another one residence in five (20.4%) were built between 1946 and 1960.  There was no further residential development in the neighbourhood until the late 1980s.  Between 1986 and 1990,  one in seven of the residences in modern Cloverdale were constructed.  Almost half (46.9%) of residences were built after 1990.


Residential development has continued since the 2001 federal census.  According to the 2001 census, there were 245 residences in the neighbourhood.  By 2005, this had increased by 46%, with the 2005 municipal census reporting 358 residences.


The most common type of residence, according to the 2005 municipal census, is the single-family dwelling.  These account for approximately half (47%) of all residences in the neighbourhood.  One in three (36%) are apartment style condominiums in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories.  One in six residences (16%) are row houses.  There is also one triplex in the neighbourhood.  Almost six out of every seven (86%) of all residences are owner-occupied and one out of seven (14%) are rented.",1,29 March 2007, 1 January 2021,59,0,0

11005092,Don Maestri,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Maestri,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don_Maestri&action=info,"Donald D. Maestri Jr. (born October 25, 1946) is an American college basketball coach who was the head men's basketball coach at Troy University from 1982 to 2013. Prior to accepting this position, Maestri was an assistant coach at Mississippi State University from 1979 to 1980 and at the University of Alabama from 1980 to 1982. Maestri coached the Trojans to a record of 500â404, one NCAA Basketball Tournament, five regular season conference titles, and one conference tournament title over the course of 26 seasons at Troy. He has been named coach of the year in the East Coast Conference (1994), the Summit League (1997, then known as the Mid-Continent Conference), Atlantic Sun Conference (2000 and 2004) and the Sun Belt Conference (2009)


Maestri is famous for his run and gun style of basketball, which has led the Trojans to lead Division I NCAA basketball in three-pointers per game three consecutive seasons, from 2003 to 2006. He also coached Troy to a 258â141 win over the DeVry Institute of Atlanta on January 12, 1992, which is the highest scoring basketball game in NCAA history. Ironically, his emphasis on defensive pressure and a lock-down style of basketball pushed the Trojans to two Division II Final Fours in six years.


Five different conferences have called Maestri its Coach of the Year, tying him with West Virginia's Bob Huggins for the most among active coaches.


He earned his 500th career win against Florida Atlantic in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament in 2013.  Maestri retired from the program on March 9, 2013.


Maestri grew up in New Orleans and graduated from De La Salle High School in 1964. After high school, Maestri attended the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he graduated in 1968 with a double major B.S. in mathematics and physical education. After graduating from Southern Mississippi, Maestri stayed in Hattiesburg to work as a math and physical education teacher at Beeson Academy in the 1968â69 school year.


Maestri began his coaching career in the fall of 1970 at Holy Cross High School in his hometown of New Orleans.  In 10 seasons as coach, he posted a 211â99 record, leading Holy Cross to a state runner-up finish in the top classification in the Louisiana high school ranks in 1974. This 1974 team had a final record of 35â6.


His 1976 team finished with a 32â3 record and was ranked 11th in the nation.


Maestri's teams also finished 1st or 2nd place six times in the Catholic League.



Maestri spent the 1979â80 season as an assistant coach for Jim Hatfield at Mississippi State.  During his one year with the program, the Bulldogs finished with a 13â14 record and tied for 6th in the Southeastern Conference.


Maestri spent two seasons at the University of Alabama on Winfrey Sanderson's staff (1980â82).  During his time with the Crimson Tide, Alabama participated in the NIT and NCAA tournaments.


Alabama finished 24â7 in 1982, winning the Southeastern Conference Tournament and advancing to the NCAA East Regional.


Maestri was named the head coach of the Troy University basketball team in 1982.  When he took over the reins of the Troy basketball program, the Trojans had not posted a winning season in the previous five seasons.


Maestri quickly turned the program into a perennial Division II powerhouse.  He led the Trojans to a Gulf South Conference title in the 1990â91 season, where they received an invitation to the NCAA Tournament, defeating Florida Southern 78â73 in the 1st Round before falling to North Alabama 86â93 in the 2nd round.  He was named Gulf South Coach of the Year for his efforts.


The head coach led Troy State to five NCAA Tournament appearances in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993.  Maestri finished with an overall record of 237â131 in Division II.


During the 1987â88 season, the Trojans finished with a 24â10, winning the Gulf South Conference title.  Troy State made it to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament before falling 77â72 to AlaskaâAnchorage.


Five seasons later, in 1992â93, Maestri helped the Trojans to a 27â5 record and led them to the NCAA Tournament Finals, only to fall to Cal State Bakersfield 85â72.  Maestri was named Southeast Region Coach of the Year by the NCAA following his team's brilliant season.


During Troy's first season at the Division I level, 1993â94, Maestri's run-and-gun style shot the Trojans to a conference title, going undefeated in the East Coast Conference and winning the conference title. Troy also gained national recognition by leading the nation in three-pointers made per game while averaging 97.6 points per contest.  For his efforts, Maestri was named East Coast Conference Coach of the Year.


In 1995, Troy State left the East Coast Conference to join the Mid-Continent Conference (now the Summit League).


During the 1996â97 season, the Trojans were back in contention in the Mid-Continent Conference, upsetting Sweet 16 participant Valparaiso, 72â69, on the road in overtime to cap a 17â10 record. Troy claimed third place in the conference that year, with Maestri earning Coach of the Year honors again.


The Trojans left the Mid-Continent Conference to join the Atlantic Sun Conference in 1998.  Maestri's teams struggled mightily their first two seasons in the Atlantic Sun in 1998 and 1999, but quickly turned their fortunes around the next season.  In 2000, Maestri brought the Trojans their first conference title in six years and their first Division I conference title.  Though the Trojans won the regular season title that year, they did not win the conference tournament, thus keeping them from getting in the NCAA Tournament.


Two seasons later, in the 2001â02 season, Maestri was once again able to lead his team to another Atlantic Sun regular season title.  Once again though, his Trojans failed to win the conference tournament and were once again left out of the NCAA Tournament.


In the 2002â03, Maestri recorded his best season ever in Division I.  He coached his team to a 26â6 record and they won the Atlantic Sun regular season and conference tournament titles.  During the season, the team defeated a Southeastern Conference for the first time ever, defeating Arkansas 74â66.  The Trojans received their first ever invitation to the NCAA Tournament as a Division I program.  They fell to Xavier 59â71 in the 1st round.


The very next season, 2003â04, Maestri once again coached Troy to an Atlantic Sun regular season title for the third consecutive time and finished the season with an 18â2 conference record and a 24â7 record overall.  To this day the 18 league victories is the highest single-season total for any Atlantic Sun school.  The veteran coach earned A-Sun Coach of the Year honors.  Maestri's Trojans received an invitation to the NIT, where they would be defeated in the first round by Niagara, 83â87. The Trojans finished the year second in Division I in scoring at 84.6 points per game, and ninth in scoring margin, winning by an average of 12.0 points per game. Troy also led all of college basketball in three-point field goals made with 346.


In 2005, Troy joined the Sun Belt Conference.  Maestri's teams did not finish with a winning record from the 2004â05 season to the 2007â08 season.


Maestri was finally able to coach his team to winning record once again during the 2008â09 season.  Troy finished with a 19â13 record and received an invitation to the CBI tournament, where they were defeated by the College of Charleston in the 1st round, 91â93.  Maestri was awarded the Sun Belt Coach of the Year and was also named Coach of the Year by highly respected CollegeInsider.com following the successful campaign.


During Maestri's 2009â10 campaign, the Trojans finished with a 20â13 record and recorded the programs first-ever win over in-state opponent Auburn, upsetting the Tigers in BeardâEaves Coliseum by a score of 81â77.  His team went on to win the Sun Belt regular season title and compete in the NIT Tournament.


He retired from Troy after the 2013 season, finishing with a 501â403 overall record as head coach at Troy.


Three years after Maestri's retirement from Troy, he joined the Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball staff in 2016 as a special assistant to head coach Billy Kennedy, whom Maestri had mentored since Kennedy was in the eighth grade at Holy Cross High School in Louisiana.

Associated with the Royal Marine Artillery (RMA) of the nineteenth century Royal Marines; he was for many years commandant of that corps. Toward the end of his long and distinguished service, he led the Woolwich Division of the Royal Marines as Colonel Commandant.


Thomas Adams Parke was born in the civil parish of Fawley, Hampshire, on 13 October 1780, the son of Thomas Parke and his wife Mary. He married Eliza Maskal at Alverstoke, Hampshire on 9 November 1805. Upon his retirement, he lived in Portsmouth with his wife and one of their daughters, Mary Anne.

35811497,MV Sound of Gigha,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Sound_of_Gigha,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MV_Sound_of_Gigha&action=info,"MV Sound of Gigha was a pioneering roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ferry operating on the west coast of Scotland. She was launched as Isle of Gigha in May 1966. On 11 November 1966, she capsized off Islay. Salvaged, overhauled, and renamed, she provided thirty years of service between Islay and Jura.


Oban civil engineer and merchant seaman John Rose and Gavin Hamilton, a Lanarkshire landscape gardener recognised that the future of inter-island ferry trade was for freight to be carried by lorries loaded onto a ro-ro ship. This was not being developed by Caledonian MacBrayne. The pair obtained a grant from the Highlands and Islands Development Board and ordered a landing craft type ferry from the Thames Launch Works, who subcontracted work to Bideford Shipyard. In February 1966, with Chris Pollock, an Argyll businessman, they formed Eilean Sea Services.


Building progressed rapidly. The ferry was launched as Isle of Gigha and handed over to the owners in May 1966, despite problems with the performance and stability trials. She completed her delivery voyage from Bideford to Loch Sween without event. In service, beach landings, sometimes in gale force winds, took a heavy toll on the hull, resulting in shell fractures and jamming of the port rudder. Water leaked into the after-peak and the engine room.


On the morning of 11 November 1966, Isle of Gigha was en route from Gigha to Port Ellen, loaded with commercial vehicles. Rolling in a moderate sea, a rudder stock cracked making steering difficult. Unsecured loads shifted, causing the ferry to list and capsize. MVÂ Lochiel, HMSÂ Murray, and the Islay lifeboat took part in the rescue, but three men were lost. That afternoon, Admiralty salvage vessel Succour secured a tow. The righted casualty was taken to Greenock.


Realising that the future safety of such roll-on/roll-off ferries depended on identifying the causes of the accident, Board of Trade Inspector, Walter Weyndling, mounted a newspaper campaign to hold a Court of Inquiry. The Inquiry was held and blamed the master, Gordon Graham, for not securing the vehicles. The managers of the Eilean Sea Services and the contractors escaped.


The salvaged vessel was returned to Eilean Sea Services. John Rose had formed Western Ferries with investment from many commercial interests in Islay and Jura. They bought the Isle of Gigha and had additional buoyancy fitted at overhaul, increasing her range of stability. She re-emerged as Sound of Gigha.


Isle of Gigha was an 80-foot (24-metre) landing craft â a square pontoon with shaped bow and stern.


Isle of Gigha arrived in the middle of the nationwide seamen's strike and quickly found herself busy running emergency supplies to the islands. In the summer of 1966 she operated mainly between West Loch Tarbert or Tayinloan and Gigha or Islay.


The refurbished Sound of Gigha operated to the nearer Western Isles, until the larger Sound of Islay was built at Ferguson Brothers in Port Glasgow. She then provided the ferry service between Islay and Jura from March 1969 until July 1998. During this time, Arthur MacEachern was skipper of the Jura ferry, continuing on the replacement vessel, MVÂ Eilean Dhiura until he retired in 2005.",0,13 May 2012, 3 July 2021,20,0,0
514897,Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands&action=info,"The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, fought during 25â27 October 1942, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Santa Cruz or Third Battle of Solomon Sea, in Japan as the Battle of the South Pacific (Japanese: åå¤ªå¹³æ´æµ·æ¦ MinamitaiheiyÅ kaisen), was the fourth aircraft carrier battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II. It was also the fourth major naval engagement fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the lengthy and strategically important Guadalcanal campaign. As in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in sight or gun range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier- or land-based aircraft.


In an attempt to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby islands and end the stalemate that had existed since September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for 20â25 October 1942. In support of this offensive, and with the hope of engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.


The Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal was underway with the Battle for Henderson Field while the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of 26 October 1942, just north of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the fleet carrier Hornet sunk, and another fleet carrier, Enterprise, heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses, plus significant damage to the fleet carrier ShÅkaku and the light carrier ZuihÅ.


Santa Cruz was a tactical victory and a short-term strategic victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, and control of the seas around Guadalcanal. However, Japan's loss of many irreplaceable veteran aircrews proved to be a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low and quickly replaced.


On 7 August 1942, Allied forces, predominantly from the U.S., landed on Japanese-occupied Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.


After the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24â25 August, in which the fleet carrier USSÂ Enterprise was heavily damaged and forced to sail to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for a month of major repairs, three U.S. carrier task forces remained in the South Pacific area. The task forces were based around the fleet carriers USSÂ Wasp, Saratoga, and Hornet plus their respective air groups and supporting surface warships, including battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, and were primarily stationed between the Solomons and New Hebrides (Vanuatu) islands. In this area of operations, the carriers were charged with guarding the line of communication between the major Allied bases at New Caledonia and Espiritu Santo, supporting the Allied ground forces at Guadalcanal and Tulagi against any Japanese counteroffensives, covering the movement of supply ships to Guadalcanal, and engaging and destroying any Japanese warships, especially carriers, that came within range. The area of ocean in which the U.S. carrier task forces operated was known as ""Torpedo Junction"" by U.S. forces because of the high concentration of Japanese submarines in the area.


On 31 August, Saratoga was torpedoed by Japanese submarineÂ I-26 and was out of action for three months for repairs.
On 14 September, Wasp was hit by three torpedoes fired by Japanese submarine I-19 while supporting a major reinforcement and resupply convoy to Guadalcanal and almost engaging the Japanese carriers ShÅkaku and Zuikaku, which withdrew just before the two adversaries came into range of each other's aircraft. With power knocked out from torpedo damage, Wasp's damage-control teams were unable to contain the ensuing large fires, and she was abandoned and scuttled.


Although the U.S. now had only one operational carrier, Hornet, in the South Pacific, the Allies still maintained air superiority over the southern Solomon Islands because of their aircraft based at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. However, at night, when aircraft were not able to operate effectively, the Japanese were able to operate their ships around Guadalcanal almost at will. Thus, a stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal developedâthe Allies delivered supplies and reinforcements to Guadalcanal during the day, and the Japanese did the same by warship, referred to as the ""Tokyo Express"" by the Allies, at nightâwith neither side able to deliver enough troops to the island to secure a decisive advantage. By mid-October, both sides had roughly an equal number of troops on the island. The stalemate was briefly interrupted by two large-ship naval actions. On the night of 11â12 October, a U.S. naval force intercepted and defeated a Japanese naval force en route to bombard Henderson Field in the Battle of Cape Esperance. But just two nights later, a Japanese force that included the battleships Haruna and KongÅ successfully bombarded Henderson Field, destroying most of the U.S. aircraft there and inflicting severe damage on the field's facilities.


The U.S. made two moves to try to break the stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal. First, repairs to Enterprise were expedited so that she could return to the South Pacific as soon as possible. On 10 October, Enterprise received her new air group (Air Group 10) and on 16 October, she left Pearl Harbor; and on 23 October, she arrived back in the South Pacific and rendezvoused with Hornet and the rest of the Allied South Pacific naval forces on 24 October, 273Â nmi (506Â km; 314Â mi) northeast of Espiritu Santo.


Second, on 18 October, Admiral Chester Nimitz, Allied Commander-in-Chief of Pacific Forces, replaced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley with Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr. as Commander, South Pacific Area: this position commanded Allied forces involved in the Solomon Islands campaign. Nimitz felt that Ghormley had become too myopic and pessimistic to lead Allied forces effectively in the struggle for Guadalcanal. Halsey was reportedly respected throughout the U.S. naval fleet as a ""fighter"". Upon assuming command, Halsey immediately began making plans to draw the Japanese naval forces into a battle, writing to Nimitz, ""I had to begin throwing punches almost immediately.""


The Japanese Combined Fleet was also seeking to draw Allied naval forces into what was hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet carriersâHiyÅ and Jun'yÅ, as well as the light carrier ZuihÅâarrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined ShÅkaku and Zuikaku. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that it could make up for the defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart from a couple of air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army's next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto's warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any enemy ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.


From 20 to 25 October, Japanese land forces on Guadalcanal attempted to capture Henderson Field with a large-scale attack against the U.S. defenders. The attack was decisively defeated with heavy casualties for the Japanese. Incorrectly believing that the Japanese army troops had succeeded in capturing Henderson Field, the Japanese sent warships toward Guadalcanal on the morning of 25 October to support their ground forces on the island. Aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the convoy throughout the day, sinking the light cruiser Yura and damaging the destroyer Akizuki.


Despite the failure of the Japanese ground offensive and the loss of Yura, the rest of the Combined Fleet continued to maneuver near the southern Solomon Islands on 25 October in the hope of engaging Allied naval forces in a battle. The Japanese naval forces now comprised four carriers, because HiyÅ had suffered a serious accidental fire in her engine room on 22 October that forced her to return to Truk for repairs.


The Japanese naval forces were divided into three groups: the ""Advanced"" force of Jun'yÅ, two battleships, four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and ten destroyers commanded by Vice Admiral Nobutake KondÅ in heavy cruiser Atago; the ""Main Body"" of ShÅkaku, Zuikaku, and ZuihÅ plus one heavy cruiser and eight destroyers, commanded by Vice Admiral ChÅ«ichi Nagumo aboard ShÅkaku; and the ""Vanguard"" force of two battleships, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and seven destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe in the battleship Hiei. In addition to commanding the Advanced force, Kondo acted as the overall commander of the three forces.


On the U.S. side, the Hornet and Enterprise task groups, under the overall command of Rear Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, swept around to the north of the Santa Cruz Islands on 25 October, searching for the Japanese naval forces. The U.S. warships were deployed as two separate carrier groups, separated from each other by about 10Â nmi (19Â km; 12Â mi). A U.S. PBY Catalina reconnaissance seaplane based in the Santa Cruz Islands located the Japanese Main Body carriers at 11:03. However, the Japanese carriers were about 355Â nmi (657Â km; 409Â mi) from the U.S. force, just beyond carrier aircraft range. Kinkaid, hoping to close the range to be able to execute an attack that day, steamed towards the Japanese carriers at top speed and, at 14:25, launched a strike force of 23 aircraft. But the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted by U.S. aircraft and not knowing where the U.S. carriers were, turned to the north to stay out of range of the U.S. carriers' aircraft. Thus, the U.S. strike force returned to its carriers without finding or attacking the Japanese warships.


At 02:50 on 26 October, the Japanese naval forces reversed direction and the naval forces of the two adversaries closed the distance until they were only 200Â nmi (370Â km; 230Â mi) away from each other by 05:00. Both sides launched search aircraft and prepared their remaining aircraft to attack as soon as the other side's ships were located. Although a radar-equipped Catalina sighted the Japanese carriers at 03:10, the report did not reach Kinkaid until 05:12. Therefore, believing that the Japanese ships had probably changed position during the intervening two hours, he decided to withhold launching a strike force until he received more current information on the location of the Japanese ships.


At 06:45, a U.S. scout aircraft sighted the carriers of Nagumo's main body. At 06:58, a Japanese scout aircraft reported the location of Hornet's task force. Both sides raced to be the first to attack the other. The Japanese were first to get their strike force launched, with 64 aircraft, including 21 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers, 20 Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bombers, 21 A6M3 Zero fighters, and 2 Nakajima B5N2 contact aircraft on the way towards Hornet by 07:40. This first strike was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata, while the fighter cover was led by Lieutenants Ayao Shirane and Saneyasu Hidaka. Also at 07:40, two U.S. SBD-3 Dauntless scout aircraft, responding to the earlier sighting of the Japanese carriers, arrived and dove on ZuihÅ. With the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout aircraft away, the two U.S. aircraft were able to hit ZuihÅ with both their 500-pound bombs, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier's flight deck from being able to land aircraft.


Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe's Vanguard force to race ahead to try to intercept and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at flank speed so that Jun'yÅ's aircraft could join in the attacks on the U.S. ships. At 08:10, ShÅkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and five Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers and 4 Zeros at 08:40. The second strike leader was Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki, while the fighter cover was led by Lieutenant Hideki Shingo. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.


The U.S. strike aircraft were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack was more important than a massed attack, and because they lacked fuel to spend time assembling prior to the strike, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships, rather than forming into a single large strike force. The first groupâconsisting of 15 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, 6 Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, led by Lieutenant Commander William J. ""Gus"" Widhelm from Hornetâwas on its way by about 08:00. A second groupâconsisting of three SBDs, nine TBFs (including the Air Group Commander's), and eight Wildcats from Enterpriseâwas off by 08:10. A third groupâconsisting of nine SBDs, ten TBFs (including the Air Group Commander's), and seven F4Fs from Hornetâwas on its way by 08:20.


At 08:40, the opposing aircraft strike formations passed within sight of each other. Lieutenant Hidaka's nine ZuihÅ Zeros surprised and attacked the Enterprise group, attacking the climbing aircraft from out of the sun. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced to return to Enterprise with heavy damage. The remaining ZuihÅ Zeros, having exhausted their ammunition, withdrew from the action.


At 08:50, the lead U.S. attack formation from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers and prepared to attack. Three Zeros from ZuihÅ attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing them away from the bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twelve Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation, shot down two (including Widhelm's, though he survived), and forced two more to abort. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on ShÅkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck, and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of ShÅkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer Teruzuki, causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser Tone, missing with all their torpedoes.


The TBFs of the second U.S. attack formation from Enterprise were unable to locate the Japanese carriers and instead attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser Suzuya from Abe's Vanguard force but caused no damage. At about the same time, nine SBDs from the third U.S. attack formationâfrom Hornetâfound Abe's ships and attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser Chikuma, hitting her with two 1,000Â lb (450Â kg) bombs and causing heavy damage. The three Enterprise SBDs then arrived and also attacked Chikuma, causing more damage with one bomb hit and two near-misses. Finally, the nine TBFs from the third strike group arrived and attacked the smoking Chikuma, scoring one more hit. Chikuma, escorted by two destroyers, withdrew from the battle and headed towards Truk for repairs.


The U.S. carrier forces received word from their outbound strike aircraft at 08:30 that Japanese attack aircraft were headed their way. At 08:52, the Japanese strike force commander sighted the Hornet task forceâthe Enterprise task force was hidden by a rain squallâand deployed his aircraft for attack. At 08:55, the U.S. carriers detected the approaching Japanese aircraft on radarâabout 35Â nmi (65Â km; 40Â mi) awayâand began to vector the 37 Wildcats of their CAP to engage the incoming Japanese aircraft. However, communication problems, mistakes by the U.S. fighter control directors, and primitive control procedures prevented all but a few of the Wildcats from engaging the Japanese aircraft before they began their attacks on Hornet. Although the U.S. CAP was able to shoot down or damage several dive bombers (the formation leader Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi had to abort the dive due to the damage), most of the Japanese aircraft commenced their attacks relatively unmolested by U.S. fighters.


At 09:09, the anti-aircraft guns of Hornet and her escorting warships opened fire as the 20 untouched Japanese torpedo planes and remaining 16 dive bombers commenced their attacks on the carrier. At 09:12, a dive bomber placed its 250 kg semi-armor-piercing ""ordinary"" bomb dead center on Hornet's flight deck, across from the island, which penetrated three decks before exploding, killing 60 men. Moments later, a 242 kg high-explosive ""land"" bomb struck the flight deck, detonating on impact to create an 11Â ft (3.4Â m) hole and kill 30 men. A minute or so later, a third bomb hit Hornet near where the first bomb hit, penetrating three decks before exploding, causing severe damage but no loss of life. At 09:14, a dive bomber was set on fire by Hornet's anti-aircraft guns; the pilot, Warrant Officer Shigeyuki Sato, deliberately crashed into Hornet's stack, killing seven men and spreading burning aviation fuel over the signal deck.


At the same time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also approaching Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, including Murata, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes in Hornet's side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.


With the assistance of fire hoses from three escorting destroyers, the fires on Hornet were under control by 10:00. Wounded personnel were evacuated from the carrier, and an attempt was made by the heavy cruiser USSÂ Northampton under Captain Willard A. Kitts to tow Hornet away from the battle area. However, the effort to rig the towline took some time, and more attack waves of Japanese aircraft were inbound.


Starting at 09:30, Enterprise landed many of the damaged and fuel-depleted CAP fighters and returning scout aircraft from both carriers. However, with her flight deck full, and the second wave of incoming Japanese aircraft detected on radar at 09:30, Enterprise ceased landing operations at 10:00. Fuel-depleted aircraft then began ditching in the ocean, and the carrier's escorting destroyers rescued the aircrews. One of the ditching aircraft, a damaged TBF from Enterprise's strike force that had been attacked earlier by Zeros from ZuihÅ, crashed into the water near the destroyer USSÂ Porter. As Porter rescued the TBF's aircrew, she was struck by a torpedo, possibly from the ditched aircraft, causing heavy damage and killing 15 crewmen. After the task force commander ordered the destroyer scuttled, the crew was rescued by the destroyer USSÂ Shaw which then sank Porter with gunfire (.mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}08Â°32â²S 167Â°17â²Eï»¿ / ï»¿8.533Â°S 167.283Â°Eï»¿ / -8.533; 167.283ï»¿ (USS Porter (DD-356))).


As the first wave of Japanese strike aircraft began returning to their carriers from their attack on Hornet, one of them spotted the Enterprise task force, which had now emerged from the rain squall, and reported the carrier's position. The second Japanese aircraft strike wave, believing Hornet to be sinking, directed their attacks on the Enterprise task force, beginning at 10:08. Again, the U.S. CAP had trouble intercepting the Japanese aircraft before they attacked Enterprise, shooting down only 2 of the 19 dive bombers as they began their dives on the carrier. Attacking through the intense anti-aircraft fire put up by Enterprise and her escorting warships, Seki's division attacked first and scored no hits. Next attacked the division led by Lieutenant Keiichi Arima that scored hits on the carrier with two 250Â kg semi-AP ""ordinary"" bombs, where the first one was released by Arima's pilot, Petty Officer Kiyoto Furuta. The 2 bombs killed 44 men and wounded 75, and caused heavy damage to the carrier, including jamming her forward elevator in the ""up"" position. In addition, Arima's division also achieved a near-miss with another bomb. However, ten of the nineteen Japanese bombers were lost in this attack, including Seki's, with two more ditching on their return.


Twenty minutes later, the 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes arrived and split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was attacked by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer Smith, setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until Smith's commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship USSÂ South Dakota, which helped put out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.


The remaining torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, South Dakota, and the cruiser Portland, but all of their torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; 9 of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before the next wave of Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.


Between 09:05 and 09:14, Jun'yÅ had arrived within 280Â nmi (320Â mi; 520Â km) of the U.S. carriers and launched a strike of 17 dive bombers and 12 Zeros, under the command of Lieutenant Yoshio Shiga. As the Japanese main body and advanced force maneuvered to try to join formations, Jun'yÅ readied follow-up strikes. At 11:21, the Jun'yÅ aircraft arrived and dove on the Enterprise task force. The dive bombers scored one near miss on Enterprise, causing more damage, and one hit each on South Dakota and light cruiser San Juan, causing moderate damage to both ships. Eight of the seventeen Japanese dive bombers were destroyed in this attack, with three more ditching on their return.


At 11:35, with Hornet out of action, Enterprise heavily damaged, and the Japanese assumed to have one or two undamaged carriers in the area, Kinkaid decided to withdraw Enterprise and her screening ships from the battle. Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat as soon as they were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.


Between 11:40 and 14:00, the two undamaged Japanese carriers, Zuikaku and Jun'yÅ, recovered the few aircraft that returned from the morning strikes on Hornet and Enterprise and prepared follow-up strikes. It was now that the devastating losses sustained during these attacks became apparent. Lt. Cmdr. Masatake Okumiya, Jun'yÅ's air staff officer, described the return of the carrier's first strike groups:


We searched the sky with apprehension. There were only a few planes in the air in comparison with the numbers launched several hours before... The planes lurched and staggered onto the deck, every single fighter and bomber bullet holedÂ ... As the pilots climbed wearily from their cramped cockpits, they told of unbelievable opposition, of skies choked with antiaircraft shell bursts and tracers.

 Only one of Jun'yÅ's bomber leaders returned from the first strike, and upon landing he appeared ""so shaken that at times he could not speak coherently"".


At 13:00, Kondo's Advanced force and Abe's Vanguard force warships together headed directly towards the last reported position of the U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a gun battle. The damaged carriers ZuihÅ and ShÅkaku, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta in charge of the Zuikaku and Jun'yÅ aircraft forces. At 13:06, Jun'yÅ launched her second strike of seven torpedo planes led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, which were escorted by eight Zeros led by Lieutenant Shirane. At the same time, Zuikaku launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive bombers, and five Zeros, under the command of Lieutenant (jg) IchirÅ Tanaka. Most of the torpedo planes were armed with a 800 kg armor-piercing bomb. At 15:35, Jun'yÅ launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four dive bombers and six Zeros, again under the command of Lieutenant Shiga.


After several technical problems, Northampton finally began slowly towing Hornet out of the battle area at 14:45, at a speed of only five knots. Hornet's crew was on the verge of restoring partial power, but at 15:20, Jun'yÅ's second strike arrived, and the seven torpedo planes attacked the almost stationary carrier. Although six of the torpedo planes missed, at 15:23, one torpedo struck Hornet amidships, which proved to be the fatal blow. The torpedo hit destroyed the repairs to the power system and caused heavy flooding and a 14-degree list. With no power to pump out the water, Hornet was given up for lost, and the crew abandoned ship. The third strike from Zuikaku attacked Hornet during this time, where B5N level bombers hit the sinking ship with one 800Â kg bomb. All of Hornet's crewmen were off by 16:27. During the last Japanese attack of the day, a dive bomber from Jun'yÅ's third strike dropped one more 250Â kg semi-AP bomb on the sinking carrier at 17:20.


After being informed that Japanese forces were approaching and that further towing efforts were infeasible, Halsey ordered Hornet sunk. While the rest of the U.S. warships retired towards the southeast to get out of range of KondÅ's and Abe's oncoming fleet, the destroyers USSÂ Mustin and Anderson attempted to scuttle Hornet with multiple torpedoes and over 400 shells, but she still remained afloat. With advancing Japanese naval forces only 20Â minutes away, the two U.S. destroyers abandoned Hornet's burning hulk at 20:40. By 22:20, the rest of KondÅ's and Abe's warships had arrived at Hornet's location. The destroyers Makigumo and Akigumo then finished Hornet with four 24Â in (610Â mm) torpedoes. At 01:35 on 27 October 1942, she finally sank, at approximately 08Â°38â²S 166Â°43â²Eï»¿ / ï»¿8.633Â°S 166.717Â°Eï»¿ / -8.633; 166.717. Several night attacks by radar-equipped Catalinas on Jun'yÅ and Teruzuki, knowledge of the head start the U.S. warships had in their retreat from the area, plus a critical fuel situation apparently caused the Japanese to reconsider further pursuit of the U.S. warships. After refueling near the northern Solomon Islands, the Japanese ships returned to their main base at Truk on 30 October. During the U.S. withdrawal from the battle area towards Espiritu Santo and New Caledonia, while taking evasive action from a Japanese submarine, South Dakota collided with the destroyer Mahan, heavily damaging Mahan.


Both sides claimed victory. The Americans stated that two ShÅkaku-class fleet carriers had been hit with bombs and eliminated. Kinkaid's summary of damage to the Japanese included hits to a battleship, three heavy cruisers, a light cruiser, and possible hits on another heavy cruiser. In reality, ShÅkaku, ZuihÅ, and Chikuma were the only ships hit during the battle, none of which sank. For their part, the Japanese asserted that they sank three American carriers, one battleship, one cruiser, one destroyer, and one ""unidentified large warship"". Actual American losses comprised the carrier Hornet and the destroyer Porter, and damage to Enterprise, the light cruiser San Juan, the destroyer Smith and the battleship South Dakota.


The loss of Hornet was a severe blow for Allied forces in the South Pacific, leaving Enterprise as the one operational, but damaged, Allied carrier in the entire Pacific theater. As she retreated from the battle, the crew posted a sign on the flight deck: ""Enterprise vs Japan"". Enterprise received temporary repairs at New Caledonia and, although not fully restored, returned to the southern Solomons area just two weeks later to support Allied forces during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. There she played an important role in what turned out to be the decisive naval engagement in the overall campaign for Guadalcanal when her aircraft sank several Japanese warships and troop transports during the naval skirmishes around Henderson Field. The lack of carriers pressed the Americans and Japanese to deploy battleships in night operations around Guadalcanal, one of only two actions in the entire Pacific War in which battleships fought each other, with South Dakota again being damaged while two Japanese battleships were lost.


Although the Battle of Santa Cruz was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it came at a high cost for their naval forces, as Jun'yÅ was the only active aircraft carrier left to challenge Enterprise or Henderson Field for the remainder of the Guadalcanal campaign. Zuikaku, despite being undamaged and having recovered the aircraft from the two damaged carriers, returned to home islands via Truk for training and aircraft ferrying duties, returning to the South Pacific only in February 1943 to cover the evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal. Both damaged carriers were forced to return to Japan for extensive repairs and refitting. After repair, ZuihÅ returned to Truk in late January 1943. ShÅkaku was under repair until March 1943 and did not return to the front until July 1943, when she was reunited with Zuikaku at Truk.


The most significant losses for the Japanese Navy were in aircrew. The U.S. lost 81 of the 175 aircraft that were available at the start of the battle; of these, 33 were fighters, 28 were dive-bombers, and 20 were torpedo bombers. Only 26 pilots and aircrew members were lost, though. The Japanese fared much worse, especially in airmen; in addition to losing 99 aircraft of the 203 involved in the battle, they lost 148 pilots and aircrew members, including two dive bomber group leaders, three torpedo squadron leaders, and eighteen other section or flight leaders. The most notable casualties were the commanders of the first two strikes â Murata and Seki. Forty-nine percent of the Japanese torpedo bomber aircrews involved in the battle were killed, along with 39% of the dive bomber crews and 20% of the fighter pilots. The Japanese lost more aircrew at Santa Cruz than they had lost in each of the three previous carrier battles at Coral Sea (90), Midway (110), and Eastern Solomons (61). By the end of the Santa Cruz battle, at least 409 of the 765 elite Japanese carrier aviators who had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor were dead. Having lost so many of its veteran carrier aircrew, and with no quick way to replace themâbecause of an institutionalized limited capacity in its naval aircrew training programs and an absence of trained reservesâthe undamaged Zuikaku and Jun'yÅ were also forced to return to Japan because of the scarcity of trained aircrew to man their air groups. Although the Japanese carriers returned to Truk by the summer of 1943, they played no further offensive role in the Solomon Islands campaign.


Admiral Nagumo was relieved of command shortly after the battle and reassigned to shore duty in Japan. He acknowledged that the victory was incomplete:


[T]his battle was a tactical win, but a shattering strategic loss for JapanÂ ... Considering the great superiority of our enemy's industrial capacity, we must win every battle overwhelmingly in order to win this war. This last one, although a victory, unfortunately, was not an overwhelming victory.

 In retrospect, despite being a tactical victory, the battle effectively ended any hope the Japanese Navy might have had of scoring a decisive victory before the industrial might of the United States placed that goal out of reach. Historian Eric Hammel summed up the significance of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands as, ""Santa Cruz was a Japanese victory. That victory cost Japan her last best hope to win the war.""
Military historian Dr. John Prados offers a dissenting view, asserting that this was not a Pyrrhic victory for Japan, but a strategic victory: 

 By any reasonable measure the Battle of Santa Cruz marked a Japanese victoryâand a strategic one. At its end, the Imperial Navy possessed the only operational carrier force in the Pacific. The Japanese had sunk more ships and more combat tonnage, had more aircraft remaining, and were in physical possession of the battle zone... Arguments based on aircrew losses or who owned Guadalcanal are about something elseâthe campaign, not the battle.

 In Prados' view, the real story of the aftermath is that the Imperial Navy failed to exploit their hard-won victory.",5,9 March 2004, 20 August 2021,939,0,0

9717748,Cathedral (short story),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_(short_story),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cathedral_(short_story)&action=info,"""Cathedral"" is a short story written by American writer and poet Raymond Carver. It was the first story written after finishing What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. It is the title story of a collection published in 1983: Cathedral.


The short story ""Cathedral"" was included in the 1982 edition of Best American Short Stories. It is the final story in Carver's collection Cathedral (1983). ""Cathedral"" is generally considered to be one of Carver's finest works, displaying both his expertise in crafting a minimalist story and also writing about a catharsis with such simple storylines. The author commented in an interview:


The story ""Cathedral"" seemed to me completely different from everything I'd written before. I was in a period of generosity. The character there is full of prejudices against blind people. He changes; he grows. The sighted man changes. He puts himself in the blind man's place. The story affirms something.

Bruce Allen of The Christian Science Monitor considered ""Cathedral"" to be ""among the year's finest fiction,"" and he wrote, ""The story is about learning how to imagine, and feel - and it's the best example so far of the way Raymond Carver's accomplished miniaturist art is stretching itself, exploring new territories."" Samuel Coale of The Providence Journal praised the way an ""unpoetic soul"" is able to describe the cathedral to a blind man: ""Even in such nihilistic landscapes, epiphanies are still possible, and Carver makes us feel them with a quiet, smouldering joy that only such accurate and unblurred landscapes in fiction can produce.""

170454,Chur,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chur,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chur&action=info,"Chur (German: [ËkuËr] (locally) or [ËxuËr]; Italian: Coira [ËkÉira]; Sursilvan: Cuera; Vallader: Cuoira; Puter and Rumantsch Grischun: Cuira; Surmiran: Coira; Sutsilvan: Cuera, Cuira; French: Coire [kwaÊ])[note 1] is the capital and largest town of the Swiss canton of the Grisons and lies in the Grisonian Rhine Valley, where the Rhine turns towards the north, in the northern part of the canton. The city, which is located on the right bank of the Rhine, is reputedly the oldest town of Switzerland.


The official language of Chur is German,[note 2] but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Grisonian German.


On 1 January 2020 the former municipality of Maladers merged into Chur and on 1 January 2021 Haldenstein also merged.


Archaeological evidence of settlement at the site, in the Eastern Alps, goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900-3500 BC), making Chur one of the oldest settlements in Switzerland. Remains and objects from the Bronze and Iron Ages have also been found in the eastern sector of the current city's centre. These include Bronze Age Urnfield and Laugen-Melaun settlements from 1300-800 BC and Iron Age settlements from the 5th to 3rd centuries BC.


The Roman Empire conquered the area that then came to be known as the Roman province of Raetia in 15 BC. Under emperor Diocletian (late 3rd century AD), the existing settlement of Curia Raetorum (later Chur) was made the capital of the newly established province of Raetia prima.


In the 4th century, Chur became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north of the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged Briton king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one Asinio in AD 451.


After the invasion of the Ostrogoths, it may have been renamed Theodoricopolis; in the 6th century it was conquered by the Franks. The city suffered several invasions, by the Magyars in 925-926, when the cathedral was destroyed, and by the Saracens (940 and 954), but afterwards it flourished thanks to its location, where the roads from several major Alpine transit routes come together and continue down the Rhine. The routes had been already used under the Romans but acquired greater importance under the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Otto I granted the town the right to collect tolls in 952 and appointed his vassal Hartpert as bishop of Chur in 958, giving the bishopric numerous privileges. In 1170 the bishop became a prince-bishop and kept total control over the road between Chur and Chiavenna.


In the 13th century, the town had some 1,300 inhabitants and was surrounded by a line of walls. In the 14th century, at least six fires damaged or destroyed the monasteries of St. Luzi and St. Nicolai, St. Martin's church and twice destroyed much of the town. The Gotteshausbund (League of the House of God) was formed in 1367 in Chur to resist the rising power of the Bishopric of Chur and the House of Habsburg. Chur was the chief town of the League and one of the places the Leagues' assemblies met regularly. A burgmeister (mayor) of Chur is first mentioned in 1413, The bishop's residence was attacked by the inhabitants in 1418 and 1422, when a series of concessions were wrung out of him.


On 27 April 1464, most of the town was destroyed in a fire, which only the bishop's estates and St. Luzi monastery survived. With the bishops' power waning as he came increasingly under the influence of the nearby Habsburg County of Tyrol, the citizens sent a delegation to Emperor Frederick III. The Emperor reconfirmed the historic rights of Chur and also granted them extensive new rights which freed the city from the bishop's power. In 1465 the citizens wrote a constitution which granted all governmental power to Chur's guilds. All government positions were restricted to guild members, allowing the guilds to regulate all aspects of life in Chur. Because guild membership was the only route to political power, local patricians and nobles quickly became guild members, often joining the winemakers guild.


The Chur lead League of the House of God allied with the Grey League and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions in 1471 to form the Three Leagues. In 1489 Chur obtained the right to have a tribunal of its own, but never had the title of Free Imperial City. In 1497-98, concerned about Habsburg expansion and with the Bishop of Chur quarrelling with Austria, the Three Leagues formed an alliance with the Swiss Confederation. In 1499 the Swabian War broke out between the Three Leagues and Austria and quickly expanded to include the Confederation. During the war, troops from Chur fought under the Bishop's Vogt Heinrich Ammann in the Lower Engadin, in PrÃ¤ttigau and near Balzers. Troops from Chur also took part in the 1512 invasion of the Valtellina and the Second Musso War in 1530-31.


In 1523 Johannes (Dorfmann) Comander was appointed parish priest of St. Martin's Church and began preaching the new faith of the Protestant Reformation. It spread rapidly and by 1524-25 the bishop had fled the city and Protestant services were taking place in the churches of St. Martin and St. Regula. The Ilanz articles of 1524 and 1526 allowed each resident of the Three Leagues to choose their religion, and sharply reduced the political and secular power of the Bishop of Chur and all monasteries in League territory. By 1527 all of Chur, except the bishop's estates, had adopted the Reformation. On 1 January 1529 Abbot Theodore Schlegel was publicly beheaded. Bishop Thomas Planta, a friend of St. Charles Borromeo, tried, but without success, to suppress Protestantism. He died, probably poisoned, 5 May 1565.


During the 16th century the German language started to prevail over Romansh. In 1479 about 300 houses and stalls burned in another fire. Nearly a century later on 23 July 1574, a fire destroyed 174 houses and 114 stalls, or about half the city. Two years later on 21 October 1576, another 53 houses were burned. Two years after the 1576 fire, the perpetrator, Hauptmann StÃ¶r, was executed.


After the Napoleonic Wars, the Three Leagues became the canton of GraubÃ¼nden in 1803. The guild constitution of the city of Chur lasted until 1839, while in 1874 the Burgergemeinde was replaced by an Einwohnergemeinde. When GraubÃ¼nden became a canton in 1803, Chur was chosen as its capital.


Chur had an area, (as of the 2004/09 survey) of 54.33Â km2 (20.98Â sqÂ mi). Of this area, about 17.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while 52.1% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, 26.5% is settled (buildings or roads) and 3.9% is unproductive land. Over the past two decades (1979/85â2004/09) the amount of land that is settled has increased by 86Â ha (210 acres) and the agricultural land has decreased by 87Â ha (210 acres).


Chur is situated at a height of 1,949Â ft (594Â m) above sea level, on the right bank of the torrent Plessur, just as it issues from the valley Schanfigg, and about a mile above its junction with the Rhine, almost entirely surrounded by the Alps, overshadowed by the Mittenberg (northeast) and Pizoggel (southwest), hills that guard the entrance to the deep-cut valley Schanfigg.


The altitude in the city area varies from 600 meters (2,000Â ft) above sea level to 1,800 meters (5,900Â ft) above sea level, the Churer Hausberg BrambrÃ¼esch (accessible from the Old Town) situated at 2,174 meters (7,133Â ft) above sea level.


The water of Chur's spring is exported and sold as Passugger mineral water.


Chur has an oceanic climate in spite of its inland position. Summers are warm and sometimes hot, normally averaging around 25Â Â°C (77Â Â°F) during the day, whilst winter means are around freezing, with daytime temperatures being about 5Â Â°C (41Â Â°F). Between 1981 and 2010 Chur had an average of 104.6 days of rain per year and on average received 849Â mm (33.4Â in) of precipitation.

Lin International,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Y._Lin_International,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T._Y._Lin_International&action=info,"T.Â Y.Â LinÂ International (TYLI) is a global, multi-disciplinary infrastructure services firm. Headquartered in San Francisco, TYLI established its business in the design of long-span bridges and specialty structures.


The firm provides a range of planning, design, construction and project management services to the aviation; bridge; facilities; mobility, planning, and management; ports and marine; rail and transit; and surface transportation industries. TYLI operates from more than 50 regional centers across four continents, and employs a professional staff of more than 3,000 engineers, planners, architects and scientists.


1950s: TYLI was founded on June 1, 1954 by Tung-Yen Lin, a Chinese-American structural engineer recognized worldwide as an innovator in bridge design, engineering, and construction. Lin is credited with standardizing the practical use of prestressed concrete. He is also known for his emphasis on the structural aesthetics aspect of engineering, regardless of a project's economic limitations.


1960sâ1970s: Lin continued to expand his firm's specialty in prestressed concrete to broader consulting services, with projects that included conventionally reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, and timber-framed structures. In 1967, he designed the 18-story shear wall Bank of America building in Managua, Nicaragua. The reinforced concrete tower was one of only two structures left standing after the country's 1972 earthquake. Lin also became known for his design innovations, such as the Rio Colorado Bridge, an upside-down suspension bridge spanning a deep gorge in Costa Rica. In the early '70s, the firm also established offices in Taiwan and Singapore.


1980s: TYLI expanded with new offices in Kuala Lumpur and a merger with Maine-based Hunter-Bellow Associates in the U.S. In 1986, when U.S. President Ronald Reagan presented Lin with the National Medal of Science, he responded by handing the former president a detailed plan for a 50-mile-long (80Â km) âIntercontinental Peace Bridgeâ connecting Alaska and Siberia across the Bering Strait. In 1989, TYLI was acquired by the Dar Group, an international network of professional service firms located in 45 countries.


1990s: Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in California in late 1989, TYLI helped in the development of advanced techniques, engineering tools, and design standards for bridge assessment, the seismic retrofit of existing structures, and the design of new bridges.  The firm also completed several acquisitions, including California-based McDaniel Engineering, Chicago-based BASCOR, Washington State's DGES Consulting Engineering, and New York's DRC Consultants. Additionally, the firm opened a new Asia-Pacific office in Chongqing, China.


2000s: U.S. expansion continued with the acquisition of Miami-based H.J. Ross Associates, Inc., Northern California's CCS Planning and Engineering, multi-location FRA Engineering and Architecture, and Medina Consultants on the East Coast. The acquisitions strengthened the firm's services in the areas of ITS/traffic engineering and transportation engineering through its aviation and rail and transit line of businesses for such projects as Miami International Airport's expansion project. In Asia, TYLI oversaw the design of major bridges in China's fast-growing central region, including the Shibanpo Bridge and the Caiyunba Bridge in Chongqing, and the Second Wujiang Bridge in Fulin.


2010s: TYLI oversaw the design of 25 elevated bridges across Taiwan for the island's new High Speed Rail system and the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge, which is downstream of the Hoover Dam; the Port Mann Bridge in British Columbia; Canada (2012); the new Eastern Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (2013) and the Champlain Bridge, Montreal (2019-present), also called the Samuel De Champlain Bridge, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

397465,Shinobi Shaw,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobi_Shaw,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shinobi_Shaw&action=info,"Shinobi Shaw, also known as a Black King of the Hellfire Club, is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the X-Men and their affiliated teams. Created by Chris Claremont, Jim Lee and Whilce Portacio, the character first appeared in X-Factor No. 67 (June 1991). He is the son of the former Black King Sebastian Shaw and is a mutant with the ability to control the density of his own body.


Shinobi is the son of Sebastian Shaw, the leader of the Hellfire Club. In his first appearance, Shaw is revealed to have engaged in a series of financial machinations to ruin his father, and after bankrupting him, he attempts to kill his father by using his powers to induce a heart attack in Sebastian and then blowing up Sebastian's home. Shaw is able to briefly take control of the Hellfire Club, assuming the mantle of Black King.[volumeÂ &Â issueÂ needed] Eager to return the Inner Circle to its former glory, Shaw approaches Elizabeth Braddock and Warren Worthington, attempting to convince them to become a part of the Inner Circle. Both X-Men refuse, however.[volumeÂ &Â issueÂ needed] He also tried to enlist Storm under Candra's orders as a member, but she also refused. In his early years, Shinobi often surrounded himself with scantily-clad men and women.


Shaw was a member of the Upstarts, a group made up of Siena Blaze, Graydon Creed, Fabian Cortez, Trevor Fitzroy and probationary members Andreas and Andrea Strucker (of Fenris). They were manipulated by the Gamemaster and originally Selene, but the group quickly turns against her.  The group participates in an elaborate game, wherein they hunt and kill assigned targets for points. During one of these games, the Upstarts target the surviving members of the New Mutants and the Hellions, but are defeated by the combined forces of X-Force and the New Warriors.


After he learned that his father was alive, Shinobi presumably in fear of retaliation for his assassination attempt, deserted all of his inherited positions and returned to a more secretive mode of life, allowing Sebastian to take control of the Hellfire Club. Shinobi then worked with Spiral and Mindmeld as they experiment on Karma's siblings. However, his personal assassin Clear-Cut betrays him and aids X-Force in defeating him.


As a result of the Scarlet Witch's actions, nearly all of the mutants in the entire world were stripped of their powers. Shinobi is confirmed as being one of a handful of mutants who retained their powers following the 2005 ""Decimation"" storyline.


When Selene attempted to rise to goddesshood, it was revealed that Shinobi was at some point found and killed by his father, as he was resurrected by Selene with the techno-organic virus and sent with Harry Leland to kill his father and Donald Pierce. Selene was ultimately defeated and Shinobi's fate was left uncertain, as it was unknown if he was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as a sacrifice to Selene or if he was among those that managed to escape Utopia.


Shinobi is later revealed to be alive and assembled the Upstarts again to kill the Nasty Boys, in order to lure the X-Men out. The Upstarts are quickly neutralized and after discovering the X-Men were unknowingly working for Emma Frost, Shinobi used his own mutant powers to commit suicide by phasing his hand through his head before muttering that Emma Frost will not get him.


In the 2019 relaunch of the X-Men comics, Shinobi was resurrected on Krakoa by The Five and placed under the care of his father, who appointed him the Black Bishop of the Hellfire Trading Company. Shinobi was unaware of the circumstances of his death, and his father told him that Emma Frost and Kate Pryde conspired to kill him.


After Kate Pride is killed and Shaw's betrayal is revealed through Lockheed, Emma immediately calls Callisto to go after Shinobi, who was having a meeting with Christian Frost. With Cal as her bodyguard, Emma reads Shinobi's mind and finds out that he was unaware of his father's intentions. Emma later makes a dig at Sebastian by questioning his parentage to Shinobi.


Shinobi Shaw is a mutant who can alter his body's density from diamond-hard to intangible. He usually uses it as a means of escape, but he can also use the intangibility to reach into an opponent's heart and induce a heart attack, without any adverse effects on Shaw himself.


Shinobi Shaw appeared in the Ultimate X-Men title, as Emma Frost's boyfriend. He is a member of the Academy of Tomorrow, in addition to the Hellfire Club. One of his operatives, Gerald Levine, is currently spying on the Xavier Institute and Marvel Girl, under his orders. When visiting the school, Shinobi and Gerald attacked Jean in an attempt to capture the Phoenix God. This failed, as the Phoenix fought back, and both Shinobi & Gerald were taken into police custody. Later, it is revealed that Emma's also a member of the Hellfire Club in secret.

23064447,Smartbook,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartbook,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smartbook&action=info,"A smartbook was a class of mobile device that combined certain features of both a smartphone and netbook computer, produced between 2009 and 2010.
Smartbooks were advertised with features such as always on, all-day battery life, 3G, or Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS (all typically found in smartphones) in a laptop or tablet-style body with a screen size of 5 to 10Â inches and a physical or soft touchscreen keyboard.


A German company sold laptops under the brand Smartbook and held a trademark for the word in many countries (not including some big markets like United States, China, Japan, or India). It acted to preempt others from using the term smartbook to describe their products.


Smartbooks tended to be designed more for entertainment purposes than for productivity and typically targeted to work with online applications. They were projected to be sold subsidized through mobile network operators, like mobile phones, along with a wireless data plan.


The advent of much more popular tablets like Android tablets and the iPad, coupled with the prevailing popularity of conventional desktop computers and laptops have displaced the smartbook.


The smartbook concept was mentioned by Qualcomm in May 2009 during marketing for its Snapdragon technology, with products expected later that year. Difficulties in adapting key software (in particular, Adobe's proprietary Flash Player) to the ARM architecture delayed releases until the first quarter of 2010.


Smartbooks would have been powered by processors which were more energy-efficient than traditional ones typically found in desktop and laptop computers.  The first smartbooks were expected to use variants of the Linux operating system, such as Google's Android or Chrome OS. The ARM processor would have allowed them to achieve longer battery life than many larger devices using x86 processors.
In February 2010, ABI Research projected that 163 million smartbooks would ship in 2015.


In many countries the word Smartbook was a trademark registered by Smartbook AG. In August 2009 a German court ruled Qualcomm must block access from Germany to all its webpages containing the word Smartbook unless Smartbook AG is mentioned. Smartbook AG defended its trademark.
A February 2010 ruling prevented Lenovo from using the term.


By the end of 2010, Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs admitted that tablet computers such as the iPad already occupied the niche of the smartbook, so the name was dropped.
In February 2011 Qualcomm won its legal battle when the German patent office ruled the words ""smart"" and ""book"" could be used. However, several trademarks have been registered.





In March 2009 the Always Innovating company announced the Touch Book. It was based on the Texas Instruments OMAP 3530 which implemented the ARM Cortex-A8 architecture.  It was originally developed from the Texas Instruments Beagle Board.  It had a touchscreen and a detachable keyboard which contained a second battery.  The device came with a Linux operating system and the company offered to license their hardware designs.


Sharp Electronics, introduced their PC-Z1 ""Netwalker"" device in August 2009 with a promised ship date of October 2009.  It featured a 5.5"" touchscreen, runs Ubuntu on an ARM Cortex-A8 based Freescale i.MX515 and was packaged in a small clamshell design. Sharp reported the device weighs less than 500Â grams and will run 10 hours on one battery charge. The device is said to run 720p video, and have both 2D and 3D graphics acceleration. It comes with Adobe Flash Lite 3.1 installed.


Pegatron, an Asus company, showed a working prototype of a smartbook in August 2009. It consisted of an ARM Cortex-A8 based Freescale i.MX515 supports 2D/3D graphics as well as 720p HD video, 512 MB DDR2 RAM, 1024x600 8.9"" LCD screen, Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11g and run off a SD card. It also featured one USB and one micro USB port, a VGA port as well as a card reader. The smartbook ran Ubuntu Netbook 9.04 and contained a version of  Adobe Flash Player which was out of date. The bill of materials for the Pegatron smartbook prototype was $120.


In November 2009 Pegatron said it had received a large number of orders for smartbooks that would launch in early 2010. The devices were rumored to sell for about $200 when subsidized. Asus announced plans to release their own smartbook in the first quarter of 2010.


Qualcomm was expected to announce a smartbook on November 12, 2009 at an analyst meeting.
A Lenovo device concept was shown, and announced in January 2010.
In May 2010 the Skylight was cancelled.


In late January 2010 a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) listing featured a device from HP that was referred as smartbook, while a prototype of the same device was already shown earlier. In beginning February on Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, HP announced it will bring this device to market. The specifications will most likely be following:


In the end of March 2010 the smartbook made an appearance at FCC again, this time listing its 3G capabilities. According to FCC, the device will support GSM 850 and 1900, as well as WCDMA II and V bands. These WCDMA bands may indicate the usage in AT&T network in the United States. Details of the product is now available on the HP website.


In June 2010, a smartbook device from Toshiba was announced. It features Nvidia Tegra processor and is able to remain in stand-by mode for up to 7 days. The device was officially available at the Toshiba United Kingdom site. Originally delivered with Android v2.1 (upgradable to v2.2 since 2011 ) it can also be modified to run a customized Linux distribution.


In Japan, was sold as ""Dynabook AZ"".


The Genesi company announced an MX Smartbook as part of their Efika line in August 2010.
It was originally priced at US$349, and some reviewers questioned if it was small enough to fit this definition. It is ostensibly a derivative of the above-mentioned Pegatron design.


In September 2009, Foxconn announced it is working on smartbook development.
In November 2009, a Quanta Computer pre-production Snapdragon powered sample smartbook device that ran Android was unveiled. Companies like Acer Inc. planned to release a smartbook, but due to the popularity of tablets, MacBook Air and Ultrabooks, plans were scrapped.",2,2 June 2009, 18 August 2021,502,0,0

It premiered February 6, 2012 on the network's Telebabad line up replacing Munting Heredera. The series concluded on May 18, 2012 with a total of 73 episodes. It was replaced by Luna Blanca in its timeslot.


According to AGB Nielsen Philippines' Mega Manila household television ratings, the pilot episode of Biritera earned a 24.8% rating. While the final episode scored a 29.9% rating.


Both Dennis Trillo and Angelika Dela Cruz's performances were praised by critics and audience saying that having accomplished leads in the persona of Trillo and dela Cruz in clean-cut bida roles helps greatly in forging a connection to the story this early. After his recent roles in TV and film had him taking on more maangas, bad boy hero characters, it is a welcome change to see Trillo in a more good guy, older brother role. For [dela Cruz, this is her first opportunity for a long time to play as a heroine instead of an antagonist. And while she may be effective in villainous roles, dela Cruz has shown she is capable of much more. While Biritera may be a harmless family drama, it would be nice to see both Dennis Trillo and Angelika dela Cruz given great material, not to mention a promising and witty young cast. Though a simple premise, the first two weeks have shown Biritera can be a fully satisfying drama with opportunities for depth.

55912482,Civilization VI: Rise and Fall,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_VI:_Rise_and_Fall,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Civilization_VI:_Rise_and_Fall&action=info,"Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Rise and Fall is the first official expansion pack for the turn-based strategy video game Civilization VI. Released on February 8, 2018, the expansion adds new features, civilizations, and leaders.


The focus of the Rise and Fall expansion is to add mechanics that emulate the potential for civilization's rise then collapse due to a number of factors. The player will be challenged in how they deal with these turns in their civilization.


The expansion introduces global eras, triggered when any of the competing civilizations reaches the required milestones. All civilizations are evaluated for their Era Score at this point based on various advancement goals, including achieving certain Historic Moments such as circumnavigating the globe for the first time. The Era Score is used to determine if the civilization moves into a Golden Age (by exceeding a threshold) or a Dark Age (by failing to meet a different threshold), or otherwise proceeds into the next Era without these effects. In a Golden Age, populations of cities are more loyal to their leader, improving their production. On the other hand, populations in Dark Ages will be less loyal. If the player is able to bring their civilization out of a Dark Age by the time of the next global era shift, they can gain rewards such as new government-related edicts. Furthermore, if the player can bring their Dark Age to a Golden Age by the era shift, they enter a Heroic Age which grants several boosts to one's civilization well beyond a Golden Age. Regardless of which Age, players select a Dedication to try to follow for that Age, which earns additional points towards the Era Score by following through on the Dedication. Firaxis wants players to have risk-and-reward play for challenging themselves through a Dark Age.


Cities have a loyalty rating, which is affected by Golden or Dark Ages. Loyalty in cities is boosted by keeping the population happy, government edicts proper, and nearby cities loyal. However, loyalty can be lost by other government edicts, unhappiness, and the presence of nearby opposing cities. If a city's loyalty drops to zero, it becomes a Free City, no longer controlled by the player, and can be taken by any civilization through military or through exerting its own loyalty by nearby cities to convert it to their civilization. This means of using loyalty to take over Free Cities can also be used to take over the existing neutral city-states, though these lose their bonuses when they are converted. To support loyalty, players can create and assign a Governor to a city through the civics tree. Governors specialize in one of seven areas, like military or economy, and provide boosts to loyalty and other city functions if the city focuses on those tasks. Governors can be advanced in tiers to provide more powerful bonuses, but the player has a limited pool of upgrade points to spend towards this across all Governors, making them decide whether to have one or two powerful Governors among several weak ones, or a spread-out mid-tier set of Governors.


Civilizations can form alliances with other civilizations based on specific goals, such as a scientific alliance to share research, or an economic alliance to specialize in trade routes. Alliances can become more powerful over time. The expansion introduces emergencies which are triggered by specific events, such as a civilization using a nuclear weapon, or a civilization starting a holy war by taking over a city of a civilization with a different religion. Each civilization may become involved in the emergency, depending on the condition: in the case of a nuclear weapon, all other civilizations may be allied against the one that used it, while in the religious case, the situation will have the civilizations with one religion type facing against those with the other religion. Each side in the emergency then has a list of short-term goals to accomplish to attempt to be victorious in the situation. The first side to complete their goals gains rewards that last for the remainder of the game.


New units and city improvements were added to support these features, as well as a new type of district: the Government Plaza. A civilization can only have one Government Plaza, but government-based improvements placed there will have a significant boost to Loyalty and other benefits of that improvement. The expansion also adds new civilizations.


Firaxis' goal with Rise and Fall was to explore the rise and fall of civilizations and make the effects, be them beneficial or detrimental, more pronounced in the overall game, according to the expansion's producer Andrew Frederiksen. He said, ""[what] we're trying to capture here is the ups and downs, sort of riding the waves through history that is so paramount when you look back at our own world."" Whenever possible, the new mechanics were integrated with the game's existing systems rather than built as a new system atop those.


The expansion introduced nine new leaders and eight new civilizations: Wilhelmina of the Dutch; Seondeok of the Koreans; Lautaro of the Mapuche; Poundmaker of the Cree; Genghis Khan of the Mongols; Tamar of the Georgians; Robert the Bruce of the Scottish; Shaka of the Zulu; and Chandragupta, an alternate leader to the already-included Indian civilization.


On the announcement for the Cree civilization, current Cree Headman Milton Tootoosis criticized the inclusion in the game, stating that they were not approached by Firaxis or 2K Games, and that the inclusion ""perpetuates this myth that First Nations had similar values that the colonial culture has, and that is one of conquering other peoples and accessing their land. That is totally not in concert with our traditional ways and world view."" Tootoosis did comment favorably that the promotional material suggests that Poundmaker attempted to bridge peace between the First Nations and settlers, putting the leader in a good light.


In October 2018, Aspyr confirmed that Rise and Fall would eventually be ported to the iOS edition of the game. 


On July 24, 2019, Aspyr released Civilization VI: Rise and Fall expansion for iOS.


On September 24 2019, Aspr confirmed that Rise and Fall would be ported along with Gathering Storm to the Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox One and PlayStation 4, due for release November 22 2019.


The game received generally positive reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Based on allegations of past involvement with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) of his native Algeria, as well as a connection to Ahmed Ressam a security certificate was issued in 2001, and on December 12 he was arrested in his home city of Montreal, Quebec. He was deported to Algeria on February 28, 2003.


In 1994, Ikhlef's brother Nabil also sought entry to Canada as a refugee, but was declined. Nevertheless, he was granted permanent resident status, and the two brothers would often meet with Ahmed Ressam, Fateh Kamal and other local Algerians to have coffee and watch television. His brother claims to have travelled to Naples, Italy alone - where Il Matino magazine published an article stating that both he and Ikhlef were in the country, and al-Qaeda agents.


Following his departure, Algeria tried Ikhlef in absentia and sentenced him to death for involvement in ""terrorism-related activities"", which they alleged included travelling to Bosnia and Afghanistan to participate in jihad, and training in weapons and explosives, with both al-Qaeda and the Groupe Islamique Armee. Ikhlef denied all the charges to Canadian officials, arguing that the GIA didn't even exist when he left Algeria.


His deportation was carried out by Canadian immigration officials, in a private plane due to the perceived security concerns. Upon arrival Ikhlef was transferred to the control of Algerian military police, the DRS, and immediately put in detention. He was held for 10 days, during which time his family was unable to obtain his whereabouts.  On March 10 he was taken to court to face three separate charges, but was denied legal counsel.


While acquitted on one count he was sentenced to 7 years, in 2005, based on ""membership in a terrorist group."" The evidence for this charge was believed to have been based on statements made by the accused while under duress.

This is an initiative to set up advanced experimental facilities for a multi-institutional observatory project in gravitational-wave astronomy located near Aundha Nagnath, Hingoli District, Maharashtra, India. Predicted date of commission is in 2024.


Since 2009, the IndIGO Consortium has been planning a roadmap for gravitational-wave astronomy and a phased strategy towards Indian participation in realizing a gravitational-wave observatory in the Asia-Pacific region. IndIGO is the Indian partner (along with the LIGO Laboratory in US) in planning the LIGO-India project. LIGO-India is a planned advanced gravitational-wave detector to be located in India, whose concept proposal is now under active consideration by the science funding agencies in India and US. The LIGO Laboratory, in collaboration with the U.S. National Science Foundation and Advanced LIGO partners from the U.K., Germany and Australia, has offered to provide all of the designs and hardware for one of the three planned Advanced LIGO detectors to be installed, commissioned, and operated by an Indian team of scientists in a facility to be built in India. A site near Aundha Nagnath in the Hingoli District, Maharashtra has been selected.


The IndIGO Consortium has spearheaded the proposal for the LIGO-India gravitational-wave observatory, in association with the LIGO laboratory in US. In addition to the LIGO-India project, the other activities of IndIGO involve facilitating international collaborations in gravitational-wave physics and astronomy, initiating a strong experimental gravitational-wave research program in India, training of students and young scientists, etc.


The observatory will be operated jointly by IndIGO and LIGO and would form a single network along with the LIGO detectors in U.S. and Virgo in Italy. The design of the detector will be identical to that of the Advanced LIGO detectors in the US.


The major purpose of IndIGO is to set up the LIGO-India detector, which would help enhance the network of gravitational wave detectors worldwide. The network includes the two LIGO detectors in the US (in Hanford and Livingston), the Virgo and GEO600 detectors in Europe, and the KAGRA detector in Japan. By simultaneous detection of the same event on these multiple detectors, a precise location in the sky can be pinpointed for the source of the detected waves. For example, the first detected gravitational waves by LIGO could only pinpoint the location of the black hole merger source to a broad area of the southern hemisphere sky. Using triangulation, this location information could be improved if the signal was detected on more than two detectors. Another important goal of IndIGO is to train scientists for successfully operating the LIGO-India detector, when commissioned. Previous studies have shown that a detector operational in India would improve source localization significantly, by an order of magnitude or more, depending on the region of the sky.


The additional funding required to operate the LIGO-India detector is still under consideration by the Indian government under the aegis of its department of science and technology (DST) and department of atomic energy (DAE). The US National Science Foundation agreed to the relocation of one of the Hanford detectors (L2) to LIGO-India provided that the additional funding required to house the detector in India would have to be sponsored by the host country.


On 17 February 2016, less than a week after LIGO's landmark announcement about the detection of gravitational waves, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Cabinet has granted âin-principleâ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal.


The three lead institutions in the IndIGO consortium are: Institute of Plasma Research (IPR), Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT).


IndIGO has currently over 70 member scientists. Bala Iyer of the Raman Research Institute is the Chairperson and Tarun Souradeep of the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics is the Spokesperson. The international advisory committee is chaired by theoretical physicist Abhay Ashtekar and has members from several international as well as Indian research institutions.

The Ike & Tina Turner Revue was formed in St. Louis by songwriter, musician, and bandleader Ike Turner in 1960. By 1964, Ike Turner and his wife Tina Turner, lead singer of his band, had a string of hit singles but no charting albums. After four years with Sue Records, they signed with Kent Records. The Revue had already built a reputation as ""one of the most potent live acts on the R&B circuit,"" so for their first and only Kent album release while signed to the label, they recorded a live album.


Ike & Tina Turner Revue Live was recorded at Club Imperial and the Harlem Club in St. Louis. The album features lead vocals from Tina and other vocalists within the Ike & Tina Turner Revue including Ikettes Venetta Fields and Robbie Montgomery. Released in November 1964, the album became their first charting album. It peaked at No. 90 on Cash Box's albums chart.


A studio version of ""I Can't Believe What You Say"" was released as a single in September 1964 and reached No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their cover of James Brown's ""Please, Please, Please"" was released as a single in November 1964. The B-side was a previously unreleased song, ""Am I A Fool in Love."" Ike & Tina Turner performed ""Please, Please, Please"" on The Big T.N.T. Show in 1965.


In 1973, Seabird Records released Ike & Tina Turner's cover of Maxine Brown's ""All In My Mind"" as a single in France.


Record World (October 24, 1964): ""Nothing stops Tina Turner when she starts in. And does she start in on this disk! Her 'Please, Please, Please' is a highly charged blueser-cum-speech which goes on and on and has the crowd screaming like Beatle fans. The other acts match her fervor.""


Cash Box (October 24, 1964):

""Soul"" singing runs rampant and rhythm and blues were never more potent than on this ""live"" cut performance by Ike & Tina Turner and their revue which spotlights Stacy Johnson, Vernon Guy, Venetta Fields, Jimmy Thomas, Bobby John, Robbie Robinson [ sic ], and the Kings of Rhythm. ""Please Please Please,"" ""The Love Of My Man,"" and ""Drown In My Own Tears"" could make this one an instant best-seller on the r&b market.

German Type VIIB submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIA submarines. U-54 had a displacement of 753 tonnes (741 long tons) when at the surface and 857 tonnes (843 long tons) while submerged. She had a total length of 66.50Â m (218Â ft 2Â in), a pressure hull length of 48.80Â m (160Â ft 1Â in), a beam of 6.20Â m (20Â ft 4Â in), a height of 9.50Â m (31Â ft 2Â in), and a draught of 4.74Â m (15Â ft 7Â in). The submarine was powered by two MAN M 6 V 40/46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower (2,060 to 2,350Â kW; 2,760 to 3,160Â shp) for use while surfaced, two BBC GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower (550Â kW; 740Â shp) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.23Â m (4Â ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres (750Â ft).


The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.9 knots (33.2Â km/h; 20.6Â mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 8 knots (15Â km/h; 9.2Â mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 90 nautical miles (170Â km; 100Â mi) at 4 knots (7.4Â km/h; 4.6Â mph); when surfaced, she could travel 8,700 nautical miles (16,100Â km; 10,000Â mi) at 10 knots (19Â km/h; 12Â mph). U-54 was fitted with five 53.3Â cm (21Â in) torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one 8.8Â cm (3.46Â in) SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one 2Â cm (0.79Â in) anti-aircraft gun The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.


She was ordered	on 16 July 1937 and was laid down on 13 September 1938 at Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Kiel, becoming yard number 589. She was launched on 15 August 1939 and commissioned under her first commander, KapitÃ¤nleutnant (Kptlt.) Georg-Heinz Michel, on 23 September of that year. Michel commanded her for her work-ups with the 7th U-boat Flotilla between 23 September and 30 November 1939. He was succeeded by KorvettenkapitÃ¤n (K.Kapt.) GÃ¼nter Kutschmann on 5 December, who completed the training programme by 31 December. She became an operational boat of the 7th Flotilla and set out for her first and only war patrol on 1 January 1940 in the North Sea. She did not record any successes during this cruise and was reported missing after failing to check in on 20 February.


She was probably lost with all hands after striking a mine in the mine barrages Field No. 4 or Field No. 6, which had been laid by the Royal Navy destroyers HMSÂ Ivanhoe and Intrepid in early January 1940.

14100238,Ernesto Balmaceda Bello,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Balmaceda_Bello,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernesto_Balmaceda_Bello&action=info,"Ernesto Balmaceda Bello (1887 â February 24, 1906) was a Chilean diplomat, who was murdered in Belgium in a celebrated case that came to define diplomatic privileges and immunities for the retinue and families of diplomatic staff. He was of Basque descent.


He was born in Santiago, the son of JosÃ© Rafael Balmaceda FernÃ¡ndez and of Ana Bello Codesido. By birth, he was the son of a former Minister of the Interior, great-grandson of AndrÃ©s Bello and nephew to President JosÃ© Manuel Balmaceda. After completing his secondary studies, he joined the Chilean Foreign Service and in 1905 was appointed secretary of the Chilean consulate in Brussels.


His immediate superior at the consulate in Brussels was charge d'affaires Don Luis Waddington, who had two children: Adelaida and Carlos. Soon after his arrival, Balmaceda started to court Adelaide and shortly thereafter, the parents of the bride-to-be found out that the young couple already had had sexual intercourse. They then demanded that 19-year-old Ernesto become engaged to Adelaide and ""redress the wrong done"" to her. He admitted his error and accepted the engagement for the time being.


Balmaceda did not want to get married, so he wrote to his family to have himself immediately transferred to another embassy. His family connections managed his transfer to the embassy in the United States, but before he could depart the news leaked, and 16-year-old Carlos Waddington, brother of his bride-to-be started to practice target-shooting in the embassy gardens under his window. Ernesto Balmaceda panicked and on February 24, 1906, the day when the engagement was to be publicly announced at an embassy banquet, he hid in his rooming-house, with his friend Javier Rengifo. Carlos visited him and demanded that he honor his word. When Balmaceda refused, he shot him three times: once in the heart, once in the chest and once in the head.


After the murder, Carlos Waddington fled to the Chilean embassy and claimed diplomatic immunity and extraterritoriality. The Belgian people were incensed at this behavior and surrounded the embassy, bent on capturing Waddington.

The Tejano Music Awards, first bestowed in 1981, was established to recognize the most talented performers of the genreâa subcategory of regional Mexican music, with roots in the music of early European settlers in Texas. The awards are presented by the Texas Talent Musicians Association (TTMA), to ""promote excellence in the Tejano music industry"" using the popular vote method to select the winner of the female vocalist of the year. Historically, female musicians fared less favorably in the male-dominated genre and were seen as inferior to their male counterparts. The award was established by Rick Trevino, a male Tejano performer, who founded the Awards in 1981.


The award was first presented to American singer Lisa Lopez. Laura Canales won the award five nonconsecutive times, and is considered Tejano music's first leading lady before the genre's golden age in the 1990s. Selena holds the record for most wins, winning 11 of her 12 nominations. The singer has been called the Queen of Tejano music, and is credited with catapulting the genre into the mainstream market. Following her death in March 1995, the genre suffered and its popularity waned. In 1998 Shelly Lares won for the first time since she was initially nominated in 1986. She holds the record for most nominations at 28. The following year Jennifer PeÃ±a won the award; the first time the award was won by two different participants since 1982. The current award holder is Elida Reyna who has the record for most consecutive wins - ten.


Tejano music is a blend of polka, jazz, rhythm and blues, and country music, with influences of American pop music. Early European settlers introduced the accordion and bajo sexto, one of the major musical components used in the genre, to the state of Texas. Tejano music has since been urbanized with the introduction of keyboards and synthesizers. Historically, female musicians were seen as inferior and less successful commercially than their male counterparts, and were often turned down by music concert organizers who wanted sellouts. The female vocalist category was introduced at the first awards ceremony which was pioneered by Rick Trevino, a male Tejano musician, in 1981.


Nominees were originally selected by a voting poll conducted by program directors and disc jockeys at Spanish-language radio stations in Texas. Winners were previously chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners in the 1980s, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States. Currently, winners are selected through a survey of 50,000 Texas households with Hispanic surnames, though anyone with Internet access is eligible to vote on the official website page.


By 1987, the awards ceremony was broadcast by 32 radio stations and 25 local television channels in Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. The awards ceremony was originally held at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, then at the San Antonio Convention Center until 1994, and the Alamodome until 1999. As of 2015, the ceremony is held annually at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in San Antonio, Texas.


The award was first presented to American singer Lisa Lopez, who had a US Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay number one single with ""Si Quieres Verme Llorar"" (1982). Lopez' core audience was Mexicans, and she became the first female Tejano singer to appear on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in October 1986. Laura Canales, who popularized grupos in the 1970s, won the award five nonconsecutive times. She was considered Tejano music's first leading lady before the genre's golden age in the 1990s. At the sixth Tejano Music Awards (1986), Female Vocalist of the Year nominees included newcomers Shelly Lares and Selena who were up against veteran winner Canales. Selena won the award and won again at the seventh Tejano Music Awards in 1987; Canales won the honor in 1988. Beginning in 1989, Selena won the award for seven consecutive years.


At the 10th Tejano Music Awards (1990), the nomination pool increased to include newcomers Cathy Chavez, Jean Le Grand, Agnes Torres, and veteran performers Selena, Lares, Elsa GarcÃ­a, and Canales. From the 11th (1991) and 12th Tejano Music Awards (1992), the nominees remained the same with Selena, Lares, and Canales. The 13th Tejano Music Awards nominees included newcomer Esmeralda along with Selena and Lares. At the 14th Tejano Music Awards, Elsa Garcia was nominated for the first time in four years. Selena twice won the award posthumously after her shooting death in March 1995. She was called the Queen of Tejano music and was credited with catapulting the genre into the mainstream U.S. market. Following the singer's death, Tejano music's popularity faded and has never recovered. At the 16th Tejano Music Awards (1998), Shelly Lares won the honor for the first time since she was nominated in 1986. Among the nominees for the 16th annual ceremony was newcomer Jennifer PeÃ±a, who was pegged as ""the next Selena"", and Elida Reyna who was first nominated in 1996. PeÃ±a was awarded the honor in 1999, 2001, and 2003 before retiring from the music industry.


In 2000, Elida Reyna took home the award. At the 22nd Tejano Music Awards, Lares won out over Reyna and PeÃ±a. For the 24th Tejano Music Awards nominees Kacy Zavala and Megan Leyva were up against veterans Reyna and Lares, with the former winning the title. The nomination pool increased for the 25th Tejano Music Awards with nominees including newcomers Delia GonzÃ¡les, Julia Pizano, Linna MartÃ­nez, Machy De La Garza, Michelle, Stefani Montiel, and Yvette, while Kacy Zavala and Megan Leyva were up against veterans Reyna and Lares who won the award. Lares continued to win the award with her last win at the 26th Tejano Music Awards, when she was up against Montiel, Reyna, and newcomers Tracy Perez and Rebecca Valadez. Beginning in 2007, Reyna dominated the award and remains the title holder as of 2015.",3,23 April 2011, 6 September 2021,69,1,1

12575031,Bear raid,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_raid,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bear_raid&action=info,"A bear raid is a type of stock market strategy, where a trader (or group of traders) attempts to force down the price of a stock to cover a short position. The name is derived from the common use of 
bear or bearish in the language of market sentiment to reflect the idea that investors expect downward price movement.


A bear raid can be done by spreading negative rumors about the target firm, which puts downward pressure on the share price. This is typically considered a form of securities fraud. Alternatively, traders could take on large short positions themselves, manipulating the price with the large volume of selling, making the strategy self-perpetuating.


The practice of bear raid has its roots in the 17th-century Dutch Republic. In 1609, Isaac Le Maire, a sizeable shareholder of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), organized a bear raid on the stock of the company.

The back, breast, and part of the belly are embedded with small scales, naked in some individuals. The length of the head divided by the depth of the caudal peduncle typically results in a ratio of 4.0 to 5.0 (rarely exceeding 5.0, which approximates G. elegans). The scales are typically lacking basal radii or are with extremely faint lines.


It is restricted to the Virgin River in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Another sizable population is found in the upper and middle reaches of the Muddy River in Nevada. The Arizona range of the Virgin chub is restricted to the Virgin River within Mohave County.


In its native habitat, it occurs only in the mainstream of the Virgin and Muddy Rivers (Water within these rivers are generally somewhat warm, turbid, and saline), and very rarely in the immediate mouths of its major tributaries. The Virgin chub is most common in deeper areas where waters are swift, but not turbulent, and most often is associated with boulders or other types of cover.


The Virgin chub is continuing to decline. In 1988 an attempt to remove red shiners (which are a common competitor with the Virgin chub) from 35Â km of habitat on the Virgin River, ended in failure as populations of Virgin chub continued to be decimated by other factors including habitat modifications.


Activities that are known to be detrimental to Virgin chub populations are the de-watering of habitats through the re-routing of stream water, stream impoundment, channelization, domestic livestock grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, polluting, and stocking non-natives.


Threats: widespread modification and reduction of habitat; dewatering by agricultural diversion; increased temperature, salinity, and turbidity of the Virgin River; introduction of non-native fish and parasite species.


Management needs: protect and enhance habitat, including water quantity and quality; ameliorate effects of nonnative fish species in chub waters; re-establish additional populations.


The Virgin chub likely evolved via introgressive hybridization between the roundtail chub, G. robusta, and the bonytail chub, G. elegans.  Evidence for a hybrid origin of the Virgin chub is based on morphology and allozymes.  The mitochondrial DNA of the Virgin chub is nearly identical to that of G. elegans.",2,2 November 2009, 8 June 2021,47,0,0

Cole,  from his third studio album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive. The song, an acronym for the statement ""Get Off My Dick"", interpolates ""Get Low"" by Lil Jon and samples ""Berta, Berta"" by Branford Marsalis, and was produced by Cole.


""G.O.M.D."" received mixed reviews from critics who argued over its production and lyrical content. The song peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was planned for the song to be released as the lead single from the album in December 2014, but it was replaced by ""Apparently"". A music video for the song directed by Lawrence Lamont was still released in March 2015 and is a period piece that features Cole as a house slave to a white-owned plantation.


""G.O.M.D."" received mixed reviews from music critics. Marshall Gu of PopMatters said that it has ""the most inspired beat on the album,"" but was put off by the lyric that's similar to Jay Z's verse on ""Drunk in Love"". Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media highlighted it alongside ""Fire Squad"" and ""A Tale of 2 Citiez"" for displaying Cole's technical delivery. MartÃ­n Caballero of USA Today was critical of the track, putting it alongside ""St. Tropez"" and ""No Role Modelz"" for their lackluster production techniques and delivery of concept, saying they ""become so bloated and desperate to be taken seriously they stop being fun.""


Directed by Lawrence Lamont, the video for ""G.O.M.D."" is a period piece, where Cole portrays a house slave who causes an uprising against a white-owned plantation. On March 23, 2015, the video was released on Cole's Vevo channel. Cole had the concept in mind for two years, originally wanting it for the Born Sinner track ""Chaining Day"" and Hype Williams as the video's director. On the video's message, Cole stated that it went beyond racism and that it was about bringing the black community together in their united struggle against oppression.

The Hull Daily Mail is an English regional daily newspaper for Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The Hull Daily Mail has been circulated in various guises since 1885. A second edition, the East Riding Mail, covers East Yorkshire outside the city of Hull.


The paper is published by Mail News & Media. Mail News & Media also publishes two free weekly newspapers, the Hull Advertiser and Beverley Advertiser, and a monthly magazine, The Journal. In 2012, Local World acquired owner Northcliffe Media from Daily Mail and General Trust. Trinity Mirror purchased Local World in 2015, and is now known as Reach plc.


The Hull Daily Mail is produced every day except for Sunday and has a readership of  13,399 .



The paper's prehistory is indicated in the heading of the first issue on Tuesday, 29 September 1885 which reads Hull Daily Mail and East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Courier (with which is incorporated The Hull and Lincolnshire Times). The paper had 4 pages and cost one halfpenny and was published daily.


Its political stance was declared as both defensive and aggressive Conservatism, though with regard to local affairs it would not be influenced by its national convictions. It would rely entirely on its own reporters and not use 'stereo'. For national news, it would draw on the best telegraphic communications. It aimed to be a profitable commercial venture, believing that profit would also ensure quality.


From 8 March 1886, the paper was published as The Hull Daily Mail And Hull Packet. The Hull Packet had nearly a century of history behind it, having run from  1787 to 26 February 1886 closing with issue number 5,288.


The on-line archived Hull Daily Mail is a valuable record of the social history of the city from 1885 to 1950 and sets its story in the context of national and international events. Alongside major developments will be found the stories of minor achievements and minor crimes, of small clubs, pubs, theatres and cinemas, businesses, churches, schools and neighbourhood groups and within them 'snapshots' of individuals with no claim to fame other than that they were there.


In 2015, the Hull Daily Mail received a new logo and general design to both the newspaper and website, replacing logos and styling that had been used since the mid-2000s, and introducing weekend supplements and a TV and entertainment guide named 'The View'.


As part of a Trinity Mirror restructure, Neil Hodgkinson, editor of the Hull Daily Mail, was promoted to Editor-in-chief in February 2016 for Humber and Lincolnshire regions, overseeing the Grimsby Telegraph, Scunthorpe Telegraph and Lincolnshire Echo as well as the Mail. In March 2018 the Reach PLC titles for the North East, including the Chronicle, Journal and Teesside Gazette, were added to his portfolio of titles.


The Hull Daily Mail changed its banner head on its website to 'Hull Live' after the company was taken over by Trinity Mirror in 2017. Trinity Mirror was re-branded Reach plc in May 2018.

Brooks' father, the Hon. Herbert William Brooks (1890â1974), was a younger son of the 2nd Baron Crawshaw. After Eton College, he attended the Royal Agricultural College, completing a National Diploma in Agriculture in 1951. That year, he married the Hon. Ann Fremantle, daughter of the 4th Baron Cottesloe; when Lord Cottesloe died in 1958, she inherited Wistow Hall and its connected estate.


The couple spent many years renovating the hall, improving the estate's farms and organising the Wistow Rural Centre (which Brooks had established in 1953). Brooks became involved in local affairs, becoming a magistrate in 1960 and serving as the High Sheriff of Leicestershire for the 1979â80 year. He sat on Harborough District Council from 1975 to 1989 and chaired it in the 1983â84 year. In 1989, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire.

20666057,Framing effect (psychology),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Framing_effect_(psychology)&action=info,"The framing effect is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations; e.g. as a loss or as a gain.


People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.  Gain and loss are defined in the scenario as descriptions of outcomes (e.g., lives lost or saved, disease patients treated and not treated, etc.).


Prospect theory shows that a loss is more significant than the equivalent gain, that a sure gain (certainty effect and pseudocertainty effect) is favored over a probabilistic gain, and that a probabilistic loss is preferred to a definite loss. One of the dangers of framing effects is that people are often provided with options within the context of only one of the two frames.


The concept helps to develop an understanding of frame analysis within social movements, and also in the formation of political opinion where spin plays a large role in political opinion polls that are framed to encourage a response beneficial to the organization that has commissioned the poll. It has been suggested that the use of the technique is discrediting political polls themselves. The effect is reduced, or even eliminated, if ample credible information is provided to people.


Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman explored how different phrasing affected participants' responses to a choice in a hypothetical life and death situation in 1981.


Participants were asked to choose between two treatments for 600 people affected by a deadly disease. Treatment A was predicted to result in 400 deaths, whereas treatment B had a 33% chance that no one would die but a 66% chance that everyone would die. This choice was then presented to participants either with positive framing, i.e. how many people would live, or with negative framing, i.e. how many people would die.


Treatment A was chosen by 72% of participants when it was presented with positive framing (""saves 200 lives"") dropping to 22% when the same choice was presented with negative framing (""400 people will die"").


This effect has been shown in other contexts:


In logic, extensionality requires ""two formulas which have the same truth-value under any truth-assignments to be mutually substitutable salva veritate in a sentence that contains one of these formulas."" Put simply, objects that have the same external properties are equal. This principle, applied to decision making, suggests that making a decision in a problem should not be affected by how the problem is described. For example, varied descriptions of the same decision problem should not give rise to different decisions, due to the extensionality principle. If judgments are made on the bases of irrelevant information as described, that is called an extensionality violation.


The framing effect has consistently been shown to be one of the largest biases in decision making. In general, susceptibility to framing effects increases with age. Age difference factors are particularly important when considering health care and financial decisions.


However, the framing effect seems to disappear when encountering it in a foreign (non-native) language.:â246â One explanation of this disappearance is that a non-native language provides greater cognitive and emotional distance than one's native tongue. A foreign language is also processed less automatically than a native tongue. This leads to more deliberation, which can affect decision making, resulting in decisions that are more systematic.


Framing effects in decision-making become stronger as children age. This is partially because qualitative reasoning increases with age. While preschoolers are more likely to make decisions based on quantitative properties, such as probability of an outcome, elementary schoolers and adolescents become progressively more likely to reason qualitatively, opting for a sure option in a gain frame and a risky option in a loss frame regardless of probabilities. The increase in qualitative thinking is related to an increase in ""gist based"" thinking that occurs over a lifetime.


However, qualitative reasoning, and thus susceptibility to framing effects, is still not as strong in adolescents as in adults, and adolescents are more likely than adults to choose the risky option under both the gain and loss frames of a given scenario. One explanation for adolescent tendencies toward risky choices is that they lack real-world experience with negative consequences, and thus over-rely on conscious evaluation of risks and benefits, focusing on specific information and details or quantitative analysis. This reduces influence of framing effects and leads to greater consistency across frames of a given scenario. Children between the ages of 10 and 12 are more likely to take risks and show framing effects, while younger children only considered the quantitative differences between the two options presented.


Younger adults are more likely than older adults to be enticed by risk-taking when presented with loss frame trials.


In multiple studies of undergraduate students, researchers have found that students are more likely to prefer options framed positively. For example, they are more likely to enjoy meat labeled 75% lean meat as opposed to 25% fat, or use condoms advertised as being 95% effective as opposed to having a 5% risk of failure.


Young adults are especially susceptible to framing effects when presented with an ill-defined problem in which there is no correct answer and individuals must arbitrarily determine what information they consider relevant. For example, undergraduate students are more willing to purchase an item such as a movie ticket after losing an amount equivalent to the item's cost than after losing the item itself.


The framing effect is claimed to be greater in older adults than in younger adults or adolescents. This claim may be a result of enhanced negativity bias, though some sources claim that the negativity bias actually decreases with age.


Another possible cause is that older adults have fewer cognitive resources available to them and are more likely to default to less cognitively demanding strategies when faced with a decision. They tend to rely on easily accessible information, or frames, regardless of whether that information is relevant to making the decision in question. Several studies have shown that younger adults will make less biased decisions than older adults because they base their choices on interpretations of patterns of events and can better employ decision making strategies that require cognitive resources like working-memory skills. Older adults, on the other hand, make choices based on immediate reactions to gains and losses.


Older adults' lack of cognitive resources, such as flexibility in decision making strategies, may cause older adults to be influenced by emotional frames more so than younger adults or adolescents. In addition, as individuals age, they make decisions more quickly than their younger counterparts. It is significant that, when prompted to do so, older adults will often make a less biased decision with reevaluation of their original choice.


The increase in framing effects among older adults has important implications, especially in medical contexts. Older adults are influenced heavily by the inclusion or exclusion of extraneous details, meaning they are likely to make serious medical decisions based on how doctors frame the two options rather than the qualitative differences between the options, causing older adults to inappropriately form their choices.


When considering cancer treatments, framing can shift older adults' focus from short- to long-term survival under a negative and positive frame, respectively. When presented with treatment descriptions described in positive, negative, or neutral terms, older adults are significantly more likely to agree to a treatment when it is positively described than they are to agree to the same treatment when it is described neutrally or negatively. Additionally, framing often leads to inconsistency in choice: a change in description qualities after an initial choice is made can cause older adults to revoke their initial decision in favor of an alternative option. Older adults also remember positively framed statements more accurately than negatively framed statements. This has been demonstrated by evaluating older adults' recall of statements in pamphlets about health care issues.",1,12 December 2008, 20 September 2021,264,2,1

Twelve teams contested the league: Aberdeen, Celtic, Dundee, Hamilton Academical, Heart of Midlothian, Hibernian, Kilmarnock, Motherwell, Partick Thistle, Rangers, Ross County and St Johnstone.


The season's average attendance was 15,932, the highest level since 2006â07.

Relegated to Scottish Championship





In the initial phase of the season, the 12 teams will play a round-robin tournament whereby each team plays each one of the other teams three times. After 33 games, the league splits into two sections of six teams, with each team playing each other in that section. The league attempts to balance the fixture list so that teams in the same section play each other twice at home and twice away, but sometimes this is impossible. A total of 228 matches will be played, with 38 matches played by each team.


In April 2018, the SPFL confirmed the prize money to be allocated to the league members at the conclusion of the competitions. The Premiership winners would receive Â£3.176 million, with a total pot of Â£24.5m to be distributed across the four divisions.


The table lists the positions of teams after each week of matches. In order to preserve chronological progress, any postponed matches are not included in the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. For example, if a match is scheduled for matchday 13, but then postponed and played between days 16 and 17, it will be added to the standings for day 16.

He is one of the most famous and popular German actors of the 20th century, and is considered a German film legend. RÃ¼hmann is best known for playing the part of a comic ordinary citizen in film comedies such as Three from the Filling Station and The Punch Bowl. During his later years, he was also a respected character actor in films such as The Captain from KÃ¶penick and It Happened in Broad Daylight. His only English-speaking movie was Ship of Fools in 1964.


RÃ¼hmann was born in Essen as the son of a restaurateur. His father Hermann RÃ¼hmann moved to Berlin in 1915, where he probably committed suicide a little later. The exact circumstances of death could never be clarified. His son Heinz began his acting career during the early 1920s and appeared in numerous theatres in Germany during the following years. His role in the 1930 movie Die Drei von der Tankstelle (The Three from the Filling Station) led him to film stardom. He remained highly popular as a comedic actor (and sometime singer) throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. He remained in Germany and continued to work during the Nazi period, as did his friend and colleague, Hans Albers.


During the 1933-45 period, he acted in 37 films and directed four. After January 1933, RÃ¼hmann did not speak openly about German politics, but instead kept himself as neutral as possible. He never stated a word against or towards the Nazis in the press, although he had been a supporter of democracy. In 1938, he divorced his Jewish wife Maria Bernheim, who then left Germany and travelled to Stockholm where she married a Swedish actor. The divorce caused RÃ¼hmann to be accused by some of wanting to secure his career; however, the marriage had probably already fallen apart, and some sources say that he wanted to protect his wife with the divorce. After 1945, Bernheim defended her ex-husband against accusations of opportunism. His second wife, Hertha Feiler, whom he married shortly after, had a Jewish grandfather, a fact that caused RÃ¼hmann problems with the Nazi cultural authorities. RÃ¼hmann retained his reputation as an apolitical star during the entire Nazi era.


During the war years, RÃ¼hmann, like others, was co-opted by the State in some films. His role as lead actor in the comedy Quax the Crash Pilot was supposed to distract the populace from the war. In 1941, under the direction of Reichsfilmkammer president Carl Froelich, RÃ¼hmann played the title role in Der Gasmann, about a gas-meter reader who is suspected of foreign espionage. In 1944, the premiere of Die Feuerzangenbowle was forbidden by the Nazi film censor for ""disrespect for authority"". Through his good relationships with the regime, however, RÃ¼hmann was able to screen the film in public. He brought the film to the FÃ¼hrerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze for a private screening for Hermann GÃ¶ring and others. Afterward, GÃ¶ring was able to get the ban on the film lifted by Adolf Hitler. A nostalgic comedy of mistaken identities, the film was probably the most popular film of his career and later became a cult hit among college students. As a ""state actor"", the highest title for an actor during the Nazi era, RÃ¼hmann was not drafted into the Wehrmacht. He did have to take the basic training to become a military pilot, but for the State, RÃ¼hmann was more valuable as an actor and he was spared having to take part in the war effort. In August 1944, Joseph Goebbels put RÃ¼hmann on the Gottbegnadeten list of indispensable actors.


RÃ¼hmann was a favorite actor of Holocaust diarist Anne Frank, who pasted his picture on the wall of her room in her family's hiding place during the war, where it can still be seen today. The enormous range of RÃ¼hmann's popularity during the Nazi era is illustrated by the fact that he was also a favorite actor of Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.


RÃ¼hmann had a difficult time resuming his career after the war, but by the mid-1950s, the former comedian had established himself again as a star, only this time as Germany's leading character actor.[citation needed] In 1956, RÃ¼hmann starred in the title role of the internationally acclaimed picture Der Hauptmann von KÃ¶penick (The Captain of KÃ¶penick), the true story of a Prussian cobbler, Wilhelm Voigt, who dressed up as an army officer and took over the town hall in KÃ¶penick. In the days of the German Empire, the army had an exalted status and Voigt embarrassed the army officers and civil servants who obeyed him without question. RÃ¼hmann was also the leading man in the 1960 film version of The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik, after the novel by Czech author Jaroslav HaÅ¡ek. He also played the role of Father Brown in three German films during the 1960s. In 1965, RÃ¼hmann was brought to Hollywood by producer Stanley Kramer for a supporting role as a German Jew in his all-star movie Ship of Fools.


His wife Hertha Feiler died in 1970 and RÃ¼hmann married his third wife Hertha Droemer in 1974. In his later years, he also worked as a recitator for German television. His last film was Faraway, So Close! (1993) by Wim Wenders, in which he played an old fatherly chauffeur named Konrad. RÃ¼hmann died in October 1994, aged 92 years. He was buried in Berg-Aufkirchen, Bavaria. His popularity with German audiences continues: In 1995, he was posthumously awarded the Goldene Kamera as the ""Greatest German Actor of the Century""; in 2006, a poll voted him number one in the ZDF TV-show Unsere Besten â Favorite German Actors.",2,25 April 2005, 2 August 2021,406,0,0

Totila was built in 1942 as the Hungarian cargo ship Magyar Vitez. The Germans confiscated her in 1944.


In 1944, the German Armyâ²s 17th Army was cut off by the Soviet Red Army in the Crimean Peninsula. At first, Adolf Hitler did not allow the 17th Army's 235,000 German and Romanian troops to be evacuated by sea, but on 11 April 1944 the evacuation began.


Together with the ship Teja, Totila reached Khersones on 10 May 1944 and both ships were immediately loaded with German and Romanian soldiers. They then headed for ConstanÈa, Romania. They survived a first attack by a formation of 20 Soviet aircraft, but at 09:30, Totila was hit by three bombs during a second attack by 21 Soviet planes. The ship, with 3,000 Germans and 2,000 Romanians on board, sank very quickly. Teja and the escort ships could not stop to help the survivors. At 14:45, a new formation of 11 Soviet A-20s appeared and hit Teja, which sank with some 4,000 men on board. The three escort ships saved some 400 men and continued the trip to ConstanÈa.


The claim[by whom?] that most soldiers saved themselves by swimming to shore is very unlikely.[citation needed] The exact number of casualties will never be known, but the sinking of these two ships is one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time. In total, some 8,000 men might have lost their lives in this incident.[citation needed]


Divers found the wreck of Totila in May 2003 near Sevastopol.[citation needed]

His studio assistants completed the work in around three months.

1849914,Anything That Moves,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything_That_Moves,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anything_That_Moves&action=info,"Anything That Moves was a literary, journalistic, and topical magazine published in the United States from 1990 to 2002. It was created as an expansion of the San Francisco Bay Area Bisexual Network (BABN) newsletter by BABN member Karla Rossi, in collaboration with bisexual and bi-friendly editors, writers, and artists to become a full 64-page magazine with an international subscriber base. The complete title of the magazine, Anything That Moves: Beyond the Myths of Bisexuality, was purposely chosen for its controversial nature, while its tag line indicated a clear intent to challenge stereotypes of bisexual identities and behaviors. The magazine took its name from the stereotype depicting bisexuals as willing to have sex with ""anything that moves"".


The magazine's mission was to confront and redefine concepts of sexuality and gender, to defy stereotypes and broad definitions of bisexuals and to combat biphobia. The magazine also aimed to combat bisexual invisibility within the larger LGBTQ community. To this point, Anything That Moves even published a Bisexual Manifesto. Parts of this Manifesto are quoted below:


We  are  tired  of  being  analyzed,  defined  and  represented  by  people  other  than ourselves, or worse yet, not considered at all. We are frustrated by the imposed isolation and invisibility that comes from being told or expected to choose either a homosexual or heterosexual identity...We are angered by those who refuse to accept our existence; our issues; our contributions;  our  alliances;  our  voice.  It  is  time  for  the  bisexual  voice  to  be heard.

Most of the issues were theme-based, designed to cohesively present the vast array of diverse bisexual voices and experiences across the lines of gender, class, race, ethnicity, spirituality, lifestyle, age, politics, culture, and sexual behaviors, desires, and preferences. Special care was taken to include a wide variety of perspectives, from straight-identified to queer-identified bisexuals, while inclusion did not require the declaration of an identity or label to indicate where one fell along the spectrum of ways to be bisexual. Changes in managing editors at the helm precipitated changes in the magazine's tag line that were made to reflect the evolving, exploratory, and creative nature of its subject matter and content.

Since the yarns are switched back and forth to create motifs, tapestry crochet fabric looks more like it was woven on a loom than crocheted with a hook.


Just as there are several ways to produce a woven tapestry, so there are different ways to do tapestry crochet. Most tapestry crochet is done with single crochet stitches, but the slip stitch, half double, and double crochet stitches are also used. Yarns not in play are either carried inside the stitches, dropped and picked up when needed (also called intarsia), or they run along the back of the stitches.


The crochet hook may be inserted under both top loops or under one loop (also called Fair Isle crochet); colors may be changed before the stitch is completed or afterwards, all of which produce different results. Tight stitches produce a stiff fabric with hidden carried colors, while loose stitches show the carried colors and produce a fabric with drape.


Some fibers may be loosely tapestry crocheted, then felted in a washing machine â resulting in a dense fabric patterned on both sides.


With bead tapestry crochet, beads of the same color are strung onto individual yarns. To produce the motifs, yarns are switched and beads are placed on some or all of the stitches.


Maya men in Guatemala tapestry crochet shoulder bags with recognizable regional patterns for local use with single crochet stitches, inserting the hook under both top loops. Both women and men there tapestry crochet bags, hats, and hacky sacks for tourists.


Hats are tapestry crocheted by both men and women in Africa, such as in Ghana. The shape, color, and design can denote social position or ethnic affiliation or may simply be a fashion statement. In order to make the fabric stiffer, extra fibers are sometimes carried along with the yarn or the hat may be starched.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin. The cartoon was released on July 17, 1943, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck.


It was directed by Frank Tashlin with musical direction by Carl Stalling, and produced by Leon Schlesinger. Originally released in black-and-white, clips of a digitally colored version of the cartoon were seen in bonus features for the first two Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD box sets, before finally being issued in its original monochrome form on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 DVD.


The cartoon centers around Porky Pig and Daffy Duck's attempts to escape the Broken Arms Hotel manager without paying their bill (on which they are charged for every luxury, including breathing air, sunshine, and goodwill); the reason for trying to evade the payment is due to Daffy losing all their money playing craps.


Despite numerous methods to elude the hotel manager (from using the elevator, sending the manager down a large spiral staircase, or going out of the window), he eventually gets the upper hand and locks them up in Porky and Daffy's hotel room until they pay up. Winter approaches, and Daffy is beginning to lose his sanity. Porky (after writing ""Porky Loves Petunia"" amidst the graffiti on the wall) wishes Bugs Bunny was with them. Daffy concurs and decides to call Bugs for advice, as the trickster is famous for being able to get out of seemingly inescapable situations. While on the phone, Bugs asks Daffy if he's tried various methods of escape, to which Daffy replies that he has. (""Yes, we tried all those ways."") The door to the next room opens up and Bugs is seen in shackles. He says, ""Ahh, don't work, do they?""


The cartoon irises out, with the ""Porky drum"" ending.


Animator Mark Mayerson writes, ""Frank Tashlin had a very personal style of cartoon direction. He chose unusual camera angles and was never afraid to cut shots quickly for humorous effect. His characters were often posed in 'extreme' (exaggerated) positions, and these poses were held far longer than other directors would dare. Tashlin's direction is so flamboyant that it is as entertaining to watch as the characters. Porky Pig's Feat is fairly standard from a story standpoint, typical of Warner Bros. cartoons that pit characters against each other. It's how Tashlin tells this story that makes it so memorable.""


The title is a play on words, referring to ""pigs feet.""


This was the first Schlesinger cartoon directed by Tashlin after his return to the studio following a five-year absence for stints at the Disney and Screen Gems studios. It is also the only appearance of Bugs Bunny, and final appearance of Porky Pig, in a black-and-white cartoon.


The cartoon was colorized in 1968 (just after Seven Arts Productions, successor to Guild Films, to whom the black-and-white cartoon library had been sold some time before, acquired Warner Bros.) by having every other frame traced over onto a cel. Each redrawn cel was painted in color and then photographed over a colored reproduction of each original background. The cartoon was colorized again in 1990, this time with a computer adding color to a new print of the original black and white cartoon.


Porky Pig's Feat contains the first use of the music ""Powerhouse"" in a cartoon. Composed by Raymond Scott, ""Powerhouse"" became iconic through its use in over forty Warner Bros. cartoons.  ""Blues in the Night"" is heard after Daffy loses the rent money gambling in the elevator. ""The Penguin"", another Scott composition, can also be heard when Porky and Daffy run to the elevator with their bags.


The cartoon is one of several from WB to have fallen into the public domain.

The California State Summer School for the Arts, commonly known as CSSSA (""SEE-SUH""), is a rigorous four-week, pre-professional visual and performing arts training program for high school students held each summer at the California Institute of the Arts. The goal of CSSSA is to provide a supportive environment in which students acquire experience and training that extends beyond the practice and improvement of aesthetics and technique. Artistic disciplines offered by the program include: animation, creative writing, dance, film and video, music (including vocal arts), theatre arts, and visual arts. Its purpose is to provide a training ground for future artists who wish to pursue careers in the arts and entertainment industries in California. Admitted students are designated California Arts Scholars, honored throughout the state's fifty-eight counties. Upon completion of the program, the students are awarded a Governor's Medallion, the highest distinction in California for artistically talented students. Founded in 1987, CSSSA is a California State agency funded through a unique public/private partnership.


Admission to the program is granted primarily to California state high school students, and up to twenty students from outside of California. The main criteria for admission is an applicant's potential for further professional development in the arts or creative fields after the end of the program. It's determined through an audition, portfolio review, screening, and teacher recommendations. Approximately one out of three applicants are accepted, parallel to the acceptance rate of CalArts.


During the early 1980s, California was facing increasing competition from other states in the arts and entertainment industry, which is its third-largest source for tax revenue. Film, television, and recording studio complexes, traditionally built in California, were being built in Florida, Texas, among other places. With diminishing interest in the commercial art sector, many of California's non-profit fine arts institutions and the state's educational community were feeling the effects of a financial backlash.


In 1982, a three-year effort by the state's legislature began to create an educational environment for California's young artists. State Senator Alan Sieroty sponsored legislation to begin the planning process. A 24-member Advisory Council of legislative, arts, and industry leaders was appointed by the California Arts Council and the State Board of Education to explore the cause of talent drain and recommend statewide educational opportunities. One of the problems that the Advisory Council discovered was that many of California's young talents were leaving California to attend art programs in New York, North Carolina, Michigan, and other states â and would eventually stay to live and work there while they went to school.


The research by the Council concluded on September 28, 1985 when Governor Deukmejian signed the bill, authored by State Senator John Garamendi, which created the California State Summer School for the Arts. The first session was held in the summer of 1987.


The program would prove to be highly successful. By September 1990, Governor Deukmejian signed follow-up legislation to make it a permanent program of the state. By 1992, Governor Pete Wilson signed legislation to enable the program to accept a limited number of students from outside California, thereby making it a national program.


âInnerSparkâ is an alternate name for CSSSA, which originated from the program itself. Students use both ""InnerSpark"" and ""CSSSA"" interchangeably. In 2010, the original name CSSSA (California State Summer School for the Arts) was reinstated as the official name for the program and is commonly used today.


CSSSA students stay in separate male and female dormitories of Chouinard Hall at the California Institute of the Arts. Each student shares a room with two to three roommates, and has two to three suitemates in an adjoining room, with whom they share a bathroom. The CalArts campus has spacious lawns with shade trees, open fields and large hillside areas, providing room for informal team sports and relaxation. Due to the extreme summer heat, these facilities are vital for CSSSA students.


Student pictures are taken during the first two days at CSSSA for I.D. cards, which must be worn at all times. Students use the I.D. card for authorization, food service in the cafeteria, recreation equipment, access into the library and supervised study and work areas.


The Purple Blurrrb is a newsletter informing students of daily performances and other program-related events, which can be picked up by students in the cafeteria each morning. The name ""Purple Blurrrb"" originated at the first summer school in 1987, when it was printed on an old Ditto machine. The program now prints the newsletter on purple paper.


Students are generally not allowed to leave the CalArts campus, other than to go to two plazas located nearby. On Saturday evenings and Sundays, students can receive an off campus pass to leave campus overnight, with parent permission. Visitors can come on campus with a visitor pass that students apply for, but are not allowed in dorms or around the pool. Additionally, the program organizes three weekend field trips that students can choose to attend. Destinations have included theater and/or musical productions, Disneyland, Six Flags Magic Mountain and the Getty museum.


After successful completion of the program, students are eligible to receive three semester units of California State University course credit through the Office of Extended Education at Humboldt State University. These credits can be used as elective units toward a bachelor's degree at any of the campuses in the California State University system. They are also generally transferable to other colleges and universities throughout the United States.


CSSSA faculty is composed of professional artists and arts educators who specialize in the artistic disciplines taught at the program. Faculty members are selected on the basis of artistic excellence in their art forms as well as their teaching abilities. Housing for the faculty is located on the east side of the campus in Ahmanson Hall.


Throughout the summer session, Resident Assistants (""RAs""), help students become more familiar with campus and residential life. RAs are responsible for managing residence halls after office hours and during the evening, and are assigned a room on the same floor where they do room checks on students. RAs are typically CalArts students.


Former Art Scholars include, James Franco, Zac Efron, Hayley Marie Norman, Kirsten Vangsness, Katharine McPhee, Taylor Lautner, Jeff Soto, Isabelle Fuhrman, Craig McCracken, Lana Condor, and Amandla Stenberg.

The station airs a Spanish-language adult hits radio format, one of the stations in ""La Suavecita"" radio network.  The studios and offices are in North Sacramento.  The transmitter is off Route 102, near Woodland Community College in Woodland, California.


In 1978, the station signed on the air, originally at 105.5 MHz with the call sign KYLO.  It was licensed to Davis.  The format was progressive country. The effective radiated power was 3,000 watts.


In June 1983, the station switched to Contemporary Christian music during the day with Christian talk and teaching programs airing on weeknights & morning slots hosted by Randy Zachary. The station continued with this programming until summer 1986, when it changed to an automated Oldies format.


In 1989, the station changed call letters to KLCQ and installed the first full-time Classic rock format in the greater Sacramento area.[citation needed]  The presentation was a mix of live announcers and automation.


In 1991, EZ Communications began a local marketing agreement (LMA) and later purchased the station.  The format switched to contemporary country music as KQBR, ""K-Bear.""  EZ built a new facility[vague] at 104.3, selling it to Progressive Media in late 1993.


The new owners relaunched the station as Smooth Jazz ""104.3 The Breeze"" KQBR on November 10, 1993. This lasted until 1997, when they shifted to Urban Adult Contemporary. On September 2, 1998, at 8 a.m., it flipped to Bilingual Rhythmic Top 40 as KHZZ (""Z-104.3""), before switching again three weeks later to Rhythmic Oldies.


In October 2000, Entravision acquired the station and flipped it to Spanish Adult Contemporary, using the co-owned ""Radio Romanica"" format as KRRE.  In 2003, it switched to the ""Super Estrella"" format, using the KXSE call letters.


In February 2009, KXSE dropped Super Estrella and replaced it with the Spanish adult hits format known as ""Jose.""  In the 2010s, the format switched again to the ""La Suavecita"" format.

The story was written by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, with the latter also providing the art with Dick Giordano. It tells the story of Green Lantern and Green Arrow, who fight drug dealers, witnessing that Green Arrow's ward Roy ""Speedy"" Harper is a drug addict and dealing with the fallout of his revelation. Considered a watershed moment in the depiction of mature themes in DC Comics, the tone of this story is set in the tagline on the cover: ""DC attacks youth's greatest problem... drugs!""


In the first part (Green Lantern/Green Arrow #85), Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) runs into muggers who shoot him with a crossbow. Strangely, the weapon is loaded with his own arrows. Tracking down the attackers, Green Arrow and his best friend, Green Lantern Hal Jordan, find out that the muggers are junkies who need money for their addiction, and are surprised to find Queen's ward Speedy (Roy Harper) among them. They think he is working undercover to bust the junkies, but Queen catches him red-handed when he tries to shoot heroin. It becomes evident that the stolen arrows are indeed Queen's, which he shares with Harper when they fight crime together. In the second part (Green Lantern/Green Arrow #86), an enraged Green Arrow lashes out at his ward. In shame, Harper withdraws cold turkey, and one of the junkies dies of a drug overdose. Queen and Lantern tackle the kingpin of the drug ring, a pharmaceutics CEO who outwardly condemns drug abuse, and visit the funeral for the dead junkie.


During the 1960s, Green Lantern was on the verge of cancellation, which gave writer Denny O'Neil a great deal of creative freedom when he was assigned the series. O'Neil recounted that ""my journalism background and laid-back social activism had led me to wonder if I couldn't combine those things with what I did for a living. ... So this was my chance to see if this idea I had would work. It was a situation where nobody had anything to lose. And I think that writing about things that really concerned me pulled out of me a higher level of craft. Also, it gave me real problems to solve in terms of craft which I hadn't faced before."" The first of these ""socially motivated"" Green Lantern/Green Arrow stories was written with Gil Kane slated to be the artist, but Kane dropped out and was replaced by Neal Adams.


The O'Neil/Adams run met with a high level of media attention and critical acclaim including five Shazam Awards at the May 1971 ceremony, but by the time of ""Snowbirds Don't Fly"", Adams felt that they had run out of steam and were producing stories which lacked true relevance. He responded by pushing for a story dealing with drug addiction, an issue both he and O'Neill had been wanting to tackle, and had encountered firsthand: Adams was chairman of his neighborhood drug rehabilitation center, and O'Neil lived in a neighborhood with a large number of addicts. O'Neil recounted, ""I saw people nodding out from heroin every day on the street. I had friends with drug problems, people coming over at 3 a.m. with the shakes."" When Adams first drew the cover showing Speedy with heroin paraphernalia, editor Julius Schwartz rejected it, since it would not have been approved by the Comics Code Authority. (The Comics Code prohibited the depiction of drug abuse, even in a totally condemning context.) O'Neil said that Schwartz ""was very supportive"" during his run on Green Lantern, and that he found the Comics Code to be his biggest restriction when confronting social issues.


Then, Amazing Spider-Man #96â98 (MayâJuly 1971) was published by rival comic publishing house Marvel Comics, which showed major supporting character Harry Osborn struggling with drug addiction. It was the first comic from a major publisher to be published without the Comics Code Authority's seal of approval since 1954, when the Comics Code Authority was founded.  Adams said: ""We could have done it first and been the ones to make a big move. Popping a pill and walking off a roof isn't the sort of thing that really happens [referring to a scene in Amazing Spider-Man #96], but heroin addiction is; to have it happen to one of our heroes was potentially devastating. Anyway, the publishers at DC, Marvel and the rest called a meeting, and in three weeks, the Comics Code was completely rewritten. And we did our story.""


Questioned why Roy Harper (Speedy) was chosen to illustrate drug abuse, O'Neil said that ""We chose Roy [Harper] for maximum emotional impact. We thought an established good guy in the throes of addiction would be stronger than we... some character we'd have made up for the occasion. Also, we wanted to show that addiction was not limited to 'bad' or 'misguided' kids.""


O'Neil's original ending to the story had Speedy overcoming his drug habit on his own and reconciling with Green Arrow. Adams protested that this ending was too anticlimactic. When O'Neil said he disagreed, Adams scripted two new pages on his own and showed them to Schwartz. Schwartz approved of Adams's revision and had it published instead of O'Neil's ending. In a 1975 article for The Amazing World of DC Comics, O'Neil stated that he still felt Adams's conclusion was not as good as the original ending: ""I disapprove of the implied conclusion of that story. Whatâs implied is that a punch in the mouth solves everything.""


The ""Snowbirds Don't Fly"" arc won the 1971 Shazam Award for ""Best Individual Story"". New York Mayor John Lindsay wrote a letter to DC in response to the matter, commending them, which was printed in issue #86. In 2004, Comic Book Resources author Jonah Weiland called the ""Snowbirds Don't Fly"" arc the start of an era of socially relevant Green Lantern/Green Arrow comics, a slant which eventually opened up the DC world to other minorities (such as homosexual characters) and climaxed in the character of Mia Dearden (Roy Harper's successor as Green Arrow's/Oliver Queen's sidekick ""Speedy""), who is not only a victim of child prostitution but also later portrayed as HIV positive. Despite her sad fate, she is explicitly portrayed as a positive, pro-active hero by writer Judd Winick.",0,1 November 2007, 31 December 2020,96,0,0

1318062,"Irving Park, Chicago","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Park,_Chicago","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irving_Park,_Chicago&action=info","Irving Park is one of 77 officially designated Chicago community areas located on the Northwest Side. It is bounded by the Chicago River on the east, the Milwaukee Road railroad tracks on the west, Addison Street on the south and Montrose Avenue on the north, west of Pulaski Road stretching to encompass the region between Belmont Avenue on the south and, roughly, Leland Avenue on the north. It is named after the American author Washington Irving.


Old Irving Park, bounded by Montrose Avenue, Pulaski Road, Addison Street and Cicero Avenue, has a variety of housing stock, with Queen Anne, Victorian, and Italianate homes, a few farmhouses and numerous bungalows.


The CTA Blue Line runs through this neighborhood, with stops at Addison, Irving Park, and Montrose.


Irving Park's development began in 1843 when Major Noble purchased a 160-acre (65Â ha) tract of land from Christopher J. Ward, upon which Noble established a farm. The boundaries of that farm today would be Montrose Avenue to the north, Irving Park Road to the South, Pulaski Road to the east and Kostner Avenue to the West. Major Noble's house on the East side of Elston just south of Montrose doubled as the Buckthorn Tavern, serving travelers coming to and from the city of Chicago along the North West Plank Road (Elston). After many years of successful farming Noble sold the farm and retired to McHenry County. Four men from New York, Charles T. Race, John S. Brown, Adelbert E Brown and John Wheeler, purchased the farm in 1869 for $20,000 USD. Shortly thereafter they purchased an additional 80-acre (32Â ha) tract immediately south of the Noble farm from John Gray for US$25,000. This parcel, bounded by Irving Park on the north, Grace on the south, Pulaski on the east and Kostner on the west was part of his original 320-acre (130Â ha) farm. The intention of the men was to continue farming, but after seeing the success of suburban communities which had recently opened for settlement, they decided to subdivide their land and create an exclusive settlement, seven miles (11Â km) from the city.


An agreement was reached with the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad allowing their trains to stop in Irving Park if the developers would build a station. This was done, and this station, still at the same location, continues to serve neighborhood residents today. The original name chosen for the new suburb was ""Irvington"" after the author Washington Irving, but it was discovered that another town in Illinois had already used the same name, so the name of Irving Park was adopted.


The original developers all built substantial mansions along Irving Park Boulevard between 1870 and 1874. All have since been razed, with the exception of the Steven A. Race mansion, which was moved at the turn of the century and now stands at 3945 N. Tripp Avenue. Another early home, built for Erastus Brown, father of John and Adalbert, also remains at 3812 N. Pulaski Road although greatly altered. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which was watched from the cupolas of several area homes, brought a new influx of residents who built many unique, but slightly less pretentious homes.


In 1872, the area's first church, the Dutch Reformed Church and Society of Irving Park was constructed on the southeast corner of Keeler Avenue and Belle Plaine Avenue. It remained the only house of worship for thirteen years. The building was completely remodeled in 1908, according to plans by noted architect Elmer C. Jensen. Jensen's spectactular personal residence in the Colonial Revival style built in 1905 still stands in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on North Lowell Avenue. By the turn of the century, congregations representing the Episcopalians, Methodists, Disciples of Christ, Catholics and Baptists had been established.


The 1880s found residents beginning to miss some of advantages they had left behind in the city, and in 1889 the community, along with the rest of Jefferson Township, was annexed to Chicago. Water piped to the area from Lake Michigan, and the establishments of a fire department and streetcar service along major streets were some of the improvements to occur during the first year after annexation.


Over 200 homes had been built in the original subdivision within the first twenty years. Several additions to Irving Park had greatly increased the original 240-acre (97Â ha) suburb. Grayland, which was opened for settlement in 1874, extended West from Kostner to Cicero Avenue, between Irving Park and Addison. Subdivided by John Gray, the first Republican sheriff of Cook County, on a portion of his extensive farm, it grew around the Grayland station of the Milwaukee Road Railroad, which is still in active use today. Gray's first home built in 1856 at 4362 W. Grace survives today in a remarkable state of preservation and is the oldest house in Irving Park. Gray later built a lavish mansion on the northwest corner of Milwaukee and Lowell to reflect his new-found wealth and it was a community showplace. Indoor plumbing with gold fixtures, exotic woods and expensive marbles highlighted his home. It was razed around the year 1915.


Three subdivisions east of Pulaski led to the development of the area in the late 1890s. West Walker is located between Montrose Avenue and Irving Park Road and is characterized by large single family homes in late Victorian, Foursquare and Revival styles. The area south of Irving Park Road was developed by Samuel Gross and was known as ""Gross Boulevard addition to Irving Park"". The housing stock is similar to that of West Walker. The section between Addison and Avondale was developed as the ""Villa addition to Irving Park"" and contains many unique Craftsman and Bungalow style homes fronting on boulevard style streets. The Villa District, as it is known, is a Chicago Landmark district, dubbed by hallowed journalist Mike Royko as ""Polish Kenilworth"" due to its heavily ethnic hue.


In 1910 the residents of Irving Park established their own park district and created eight local parks, the largest of which is Independence Park. Considered one of the finest landscaped neighborhood parks in the city for many years, Independence Park also served as the site of local 4th of July celebrations. This annual event features a parade down Irving Park Boulevard involving hundreds of children, athletic events, a band concert and an award-winning display of fireworks. In 1933 the Irving Park District merged with the Chicago Park District. Irving Park continued to grow steadily during the first decades of the 20th century. Several large apartment buildings, featuring elaborate wrought-iron fencing, fountains and terra cotta details were constructed primarily north of Irving Park Boulevard. The depression and war years saw many of the larger homes converted into rooming houses and two family homes. The prosperity following the war was diminished when it was learned that the Northwest Expressway (Kennedy) would cut directly through the heart of Irving Park. This resulted in the displacement of many residents, and loss of many homes and businesses. During the 1960s condominiums replaced several larger homes along Keystone, Kedvale and Keeler north of the expressway.


The 1970s provided baseball fans in the area with their own home grown amateur baseball team, the Irving Park White Sox. Founded in 1971 by two Irving Park residents, the late Robert Boomer and William Supernaw, this three time Chicago park champion became one of the top men's baseball clubs in the Chicago area well into the 1980s. They played their home games at Henry Horner Park located at Irving Park and California Avenue.[citation needed]


The early 1980s saw a rebirth for Irving Park as a wider audience discovered the beautiful homes and rich history of the area. The Irving Park Historical Society was formed in 1984, to help preserve the neighborhood's heritage and its irreplaceable architecture, which has survived since the late 19th century. Since the society's inception many homes have been restored and many more restorations are in progress. A survey by volunteers of the Irving Park Historical Society documented several hundred buildings in use which predate 1894, many dating as far back as the 1870s. Some remain intact while many have been modified or remodeled. Others retain just a hint of their former Victorian splendor.


During the 1990s the neighborhood saw an influx of Serbian immigrants, today there are many Serbian-owned cafes and restaurants along Irving Park Road. It is said to have about 2,650 Serbian families living in Irving Park as of 2015. Totally the number of Serbians living in the neighborhood is well over 3,000.


Old Irving Park is a neighborhood within the Irving Park Community Area of Chicago, comprising its historical core. Its borders are Montrose to the north, Addison to its south, Pulaski Road to the east and Cicero to the west, those of the original two farms that developed here in the 1870s.


The Villa district (Polish: Polskie Wille) - (Pulaski Road to the west, Addison to the south, Avondale Avenue to the north and east), was built in 1902 by a number of architects, many of them visibly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie Style of architecture. Most notable among these were bungalows designed by the architectural firm of Hatzfeld and Knox, whose partner Clarence Hatzfeld would later design the fieldhouse and natatorium at Portage Park. The area was originally developed as the ""Villa addition to Irving Park"" and showcases many unique Craftsman and Prairie style homes fronting on picturesque boulevard style streets. Although St. Wenceslaus church, a majestic Romanesque Revival-Art Deco hybrid draws many of the visitors touring the area, this historic church is actually a few blocks south of the district's formal boundaries.


'Independence Park' is a neighborhood within Irving Park that was developed in the 1800s. It shares its name with a park of the same name. Its borders are Irving Park Road to the north, the Kennedy Expressway to the west, Elston Avenue and Central Park Avenue to the east, and Addison Street to the south.


'West Walker' is an area bounded by Irving Park Rd to the South, Central Park Ave to the East, Montrose Ave to the North and Pulaski St to the West. The 'West Walker Triangle' is an enclave within West Walker that comprises the area bounded by Irving Park Road to the south, Pulaski Road to the west, and Elston Avenue to the northeast.


'California Park' is a neighborhood located in the eastern portion of Irving Park that began development in the 1920s. Understated single-family homes and family-owned businesses are a common feature. Its borders are Montrose Ave. to the north, Addison St. to the south, Kedzie Ave. to the west, and the Chicago River to the east.


Kilbourn Park (Milwaukee to the north, Belmont to the south, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the east, and Cicero to the west) is a primarily middle class residential and industrial area. Although technically part of the Irving Park community area, the neighborhood is more akin to neighboring Avondale in terms of both its built environment and the sociology of its residents.


Avondale Gardens (also known as Merchant Park) (Addison to the north, Belmont to the south, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the West, Pulaski Road to the east) has been in recent years relabeled as ""South Old Irving Park"" by some. Like Kilbourn Park, the neighborhood is more akin to neighboring Avondale in terms of both its built environment and the sociological makeup of its residents than other areas of the Irving Park Community Area. The name Merchant Park owes its name to John and Clara Merchant, whose house in Old Irving has been designated an official landmark by the City of Chicago.


Little Cassubia (Polish: MaÅe Kaszuby) was a historical neighborhood in the Irving Park Community Area between Irving Park on the North, Addison to the South, Kimball to the West and Kedzie to the East. The name ""Little Cassubia"" was coined by locals because of the Kaszub people living in the area, who also founded the Roman Catholic Parish of Immaculate Heart of Mary.





Chicago Public Schools operates public schools.


Chicago Jewish Day School is in the community area.


The Irving Park community has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by large margins. In the 2016 presidential election, Irving Park cast 15,179 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 2,673 votes for Donald Trump (80.44%	to 14.17%). In the 2012 presidential election, Irving Park cast

33924029,Buried penis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buried_penis,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buried_penis&action=info,"Buried penis (also known as hidden penis or retractile penis) is a congenital or acquired condition, in which the penis is partially or completely hidden below the surface of the skin. It was first described by Edward Lawrence Keyes in 1919 as the apparent absence of the penis and as being buried beneath the skin of the abdomen, thigh, or scrotum. Further research was done by Maurice Campbell in 1951 when he reported on the penis being buried beneath subcutaneous fat of the scrotum, perineum, hypogastrium, and thigh.


A buried penis can lead to obstruction of urinary stream, poor hygiene, soft tissue infection, phimosis, and inhibition of normal sexual function.


Buried penis is different than micropenis, which is an abnormally small, normally structured penis with a stretched penile length of less than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for age or stage of sexual development of the patient.


Congenital causes can include the maldevelopment of the penile shaft with a lack of attachments of the shaft skin to the penile shaft. While rare, it can include an abnormally large pubic fat pad and firm tissue that pulls the penis inward. Congenitial buried penis can be corrected surgically in childhood by anchoring the corpora cavernosa to dartos bundles at the penile base.


While not every obese male has the buried penis condition, 87% of men that received surgical treatment for buried penis were reported to be obese. Significant overlying abdominal fat can also create an environment that encourages bacterial and fungal growth. Obesity can also increase the likelihood of the development of type II diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by increase susceptibility to infections, making it difficult to successfully and promptly manage the buried penis condition. Such recurring infections can also lead to scar contracture, which can cause the prepubic skin to shift over the shaft and glans, thus invaginating the shaft's skin and leading to a buried penis.


While an uncommon cause, penoscrotal lymphodema causes a deformity of the shaft and scrotum, resulting in a buried penis.


In some cases of circumcision, too much foreskin is removed or the suture line constricts, causing cicatricial scarring, which can trap the penis in the remaining foreskin or push the penis into the suprapubic area and lead to a buried penis.


BXO is a chronic inflammatory dermatological process that causes sclerosis of the glans, shaft, prepuce, or urethra. This can result in a cicatrix of the distal penis and its entrapment.


Dysgenic dartos is a condition characterized by a lack of dorsal support together with the hypermobility of the ventral skin and the lack of proper attachment between the dartos and the penis. This can enable the penis to ""telescope"" into the scrotum, thus creating a buried penis.


Adults with a buried penis will either live with their condition or undergo weight-loss programs. However, weight-loss programs are slow and often do not ""unbury"" the penis; furthermore, poor hygiene from pooling of urine can lead to soft tissue infection.


While the condition may resolve itself without any intervention in very young children, patients may eventually need definitive reconstructive surgery and more urgent surgery if infection is present. Surgeons who manage this condition are either reconstructive urologic surgeons or plastic surgeons.[citation needed]


Surgical options could include the detachment of the ligaments connecting the base of the penis to the pubic bone; the performance of skin grafts to cover areas of the penis requiring additional skin; liposuction using catheters to suck out fat cells under the skin from the area around the penis; an abdominoplasty in which excess fat and skin from the region are removed; an escutheonectomy in which the pad of fat just above the pubic area is removed; or a panniculectomy in which the panniculus, excess tissue, and skin that hangs over the genitals and thighs are removed. In a video demonstrating the use of a panniculectomy in the repair of adult buried penis, Dr. Bryan Voelzke and his colleagues emphasized the need to tack the suprapubic fat pad to the periosteum of the symphysis pubis as well as the importance of not pulling down the peno-scrotal junction and peno-abdominal junction just in order to further expose the penis.


King IC, Tahir A, Ramanathan C, Siddiqui H developed a modified treatment algorithm employing a single surgical technique consisting primarily of scar release and the mobilization of the skin of the penis.


An article published in August 2019 by Dr. James J. Elist reported that a procedure involving the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant was successful in reversing the condition of adult acquired buried penis.",3,1 December 2011, 10 July 2021,181,0,0

833713,Cozumel thrasher,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozumel_thrasher,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cozumel_thrasher&action=info,"The Cozumel thrasher (Toxostoma guttatum) is a bird from the mockingbird family (Mimidae), which is endemic to the island of Cozumel off the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, Mexico. It is believed to be the most critically endangered species of bird in Mexico - if it indeed still exists, which is probable but not certain.


This bird is closely related to the long-billed and brown thrasher. It has been generally described as shy, but there have been descriptions to the contrary. It was once abundant throughout Cozumel before two hurricanes greatly affected its numbers. Invasive species are also thought to have impacted the population of the thrasher.


The Cozumel thrasher was first described as Harporhynchus guttatus by Robert Ridgway in 1885. It has been described as a subspecies to its relative the long-billed thrasher, but was considered a separate species when it was determined in a 1998 study that it differed genetically more than five percent from both the long-billed and brown thrasher. In the same study it was determined to be the basal member of the rufum group of Toxostoma thrashers. The bird is monotypic.


The thrasher is 21.5 to 24Â cm in length. The adult has a brown crown, back, shoulders, and rump that becomes more red in its tint on its lower back and rump. Greater and lesser coverts are a warm brown with concealed white tips, preceded with a black bar. Primaries and secondaries are grayish-brown with warm rufous-brown outer webs. The rectrices are also have a warm brown color. The lores and ear-coverts are a mottled grey brown. The chin and throat are an off-white color with a blackish partial malar stripe. The chest is a buffy-white in color with stark black teardrop shaped spots. The belly is off-white, and the flanks have larger black spots. Its vent is buffy and an underwing that is buffy-white with darker markings. The iris is yellow, the bill is grayish-brown, and the legs are brown with a dull tint. Juveniles' plumage have not been recorded, but presumably is similar in development to adulthood like the long-billed and brown thrasher.


The Cozumel thrasher is similar in appearance to the long-billed thrasher (26.5â29Â cm in length), but is smaller, darker in color, has a blacker bill, and the markings are more sharply defined. No other thrasher species coexist on the island, but is most likely to be confused with the migratory wood thrush. The wood thrush differs in lacking wing bars, a shorter beak, and a different shape.


The distribution of the thrasher is restricted to Isla Cozumel which is 45Â km long and 20Â km wide.


The habitat preferences for the thrasher is thought to be in low and medium deciduous and semi-deciduous forests. It may have once been most abundant in forest edges adjacent to clearings.


The thrasher is predominately terrestrial and elusive and as with all members of the genus Toxostoma, it may resort to running instead of flying when startled. Ornithologists Ludlow Griscom and Raymond A. Paynter, Jr. had noted its secretive behavior, but James Bond did not.


The song is described as a rich varied warbling, slightly scratchy with little repetition. Bond described its alarm note being similar to the brown thrasher.


The numbers of this bird declined rapidly when Hurricane Gilbert hit this island on September 14, 1988. Until it was sighted in June 2004, this bird had last been seen in 1995, the same year that Hurricane Roxanne hit Cozumel on October 11, and it was widely believed to have become extinct.


It is still unclear what damage the impact of Hurricanes Emily and Wilma in 2005 caused; it seems that the bird was not found anymore during a survey in December 2006


Inquiry from the local population had suggested that the species would likely be encountered near the Mayan ruins of San Gervasio.


The last - unconfirmed - sightings were in April 2006, where an apparent T. guttatum was sighted at the Cozumel Golf Club; in October and December 2007, thrashers were also seen but could not be reliably identified as T. guttatum. Relocation efforts continue; though at least a few birds seem to survive, the continuing existence of this species had not been verified as of January 2008.


Some scientists believe that other factors must have contributed to the bird's decline, because the Cozumel thrasher likely survived hurricanes for millennia. Introduced species, including predatory boa constrictorsâwhich were released on the island in 1971 and are now abundantâmay also have had a detrimental effect.",2,16 July 2004, 13 April 2021,113,0,0

Today, though, only one mill has been preserved, the BrÃ¼ckenmÃ¼hle. This can be visited each year on Whit Monday (German Mill Day).


For a long time in the Middle Ages MÃ¼hlheim was Mother Church to the surrounding places of BÃ¼rgel, Offenbach, Bieber, Heusenstamm, Dietesheim and LÃ¤mmerspiel. The spiritual court for the affiliated communities belonging to the Mother Church sat in this time in MÃ¼hlheim. From the 14th century, the Lords of Hagenhausen-Eppstein exercised lordly rights (Hoheitsrechte) in MÃ¼hlheim. From the Middle Ages until 1819, MÃ¼hlheim and the once self-administering communities of Dietesheim and LÃ¤mmerspiel belonged to the Biebermark (a communally owned cadastral area), and the outlying woodlands belonged to the Wildbann Dreieich, a royal hunting forest. Within current town limits once lay a place called Meielsheim.


In 1435, MÃ¼hlheim, as was so with many places in the area, was sold along with the Amt of Steinheim by the Lords of Eppstein to the Electorate of Mainz. After the Archbishopric of Mainz was secularized, MÃ¼hlheim became Hessian. In 1819, after the Biebermark was partitioned, MÃ¼hlheim got what is today called the Markwald (forest). In 1873, the Frankfurt-Hanau railway by way of MÃ¼hlheim was brought into service. Ever since 1939, when in the framework of National Socialist administrative reform the rural community of MÃ¼hlheim and the village of Dietesheim were forcibly merged to become the town of MÃ¼hlheim am Main, MÃ¼hlheim has had town rights. In 1977, in the framework of municipal reform, LÃ¤mmerspiel was amalgamated with the town.


The municipal election held on 27 March 2011 yielded the following results:


The town's arms might be described thus: Azure a six-spoked waterwheel argent with twelve buckets, in chief three Immertreu of the second with centres Or.


The travesti theatre Gerdaâs kleine WeltbÃ¼hne (Gerda's Little World Stageâ) has for more than 30 years been a constant in MÃ¼hlheim's cultural life, and been known far beyond MÃ¼hlheim and very popular. Its shows are often fully booked months ahead of time.


In the âSCHANZâ cultural hall, the converted former apprentice's workshop of the firm Stahl-Schanz, the Kulturfabrik EigenArt e.V. (a club) has been staging theatrical, cabaret and musical events weekly since 1998.


MÃ¼hlheim has its own town museum. Moreover, there are also private collections, among them MÃ¼hlheim entrepreneur Hans-GÃ¼nter Zach's Rolls-Royce Museum, visits to which are on request, upon payment of a donation for social purposes.


MÃ¼hlheim's watertower, an historic basalt structure near the MÃ¼hlheim railway station, is a widely visible landmark of the town, and is still in use.


The conservation area Dietesheimer SteinbrÃ¼che (âDietesheim Quarriesâ) represents a natural backdrop that is unique in the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. It is the former basalt quarries in the outlying centre of Dietesheim, which, after basalt mining was given up, was renaturalized and opened to the public. Particularly impressive are the basalt cliffs at the Vogelsberger See (lake).

Besides various sport fields for ball sports, there are both an indoor and an outdoor swimming pool in the outlying centre of LÃ¤mmerspiel. On the Main, there are rowing sports. Furthermore, it is possible to engage in shooting sports at the SchÃ¼tzengemeinschaft MÃ¼hlheim-Dietesheim under Deutscher SchÃ¼tzenbund rules, as well as, in some departments, under Bund Deutscher SportschÃ¼tzen or Deutschen SchieÃsport Union rules. Further clubs in Dietesheim, MÃ¼hlheim and LÃ¤mmerspiel have tennis, table tennis and football.


The Fasching (Shrovetide) parades through the centres of Dietesheim and MÃ¼hlheim on Shrove Monday (Rosenmontag) and the one through LÃ¤mmerspiel on Shrove Tuesday draw a great number of visitors each year from the whole region.


In late July, the cultural club Artificial Family e. V. stages a popular music festival in the former quarries, the Steinbruchfestival (âQuarry Festivalâ). Also widely popular and well attended in the region is the kermis (Kerb) in the outlying centre of Dietesheim, held each year on the weekend after 15 August. In the main centre of MÃ¼hlheim, the Old Town Festival (Altstadtfest) and the Christmas Market (Weihnachtsmarkt) are very popular, too.


Every June the SchÃ¼tzengemeinschaft MÃ¼hlheim-Dietesheim (sport shooting club) stages its company and club cup tournament. Eligible to enter are all MÃ¼hlheim clubs (about 150) and businesses.


As an Electoral Mainz holding, MÃ¼hlheim was long a purely Catholic place. The two parishes of St. Maximilian Kolbe and St. Markus as well as the ones in the outlying centres belong as parts of the Deanery of Rodgau to the Diocese of Mainz.


The Evangelical parishes of Friedensgemeinde (âPeace Parishâ) and Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Gemeinde are part of the Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau.


The Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Evangelical Methodist Church have congregations in town.


The Jehovah's Witnesses have a Kingdom Hall in MÃ¼hlheim.


Until the late 1970s, MÃ¼hlheim was an important industrial centre in the Offenbach district. In particular, basalt production at the quarries in Dietesheim, the chemical industry (Leonhardt dyeworks as well as rubber processing), gravel quarrying, leatherworking metal industries and the electrical industry were important factors in the economy. Since the end of the 1970s, a broad array of midsized businesses has settled in MÃ¼hlheim. Great industrial works are today seldom seen in MÃ¼hlheim.


Like many places in the Offenbach district, MÃ¼hlheim is also affected by a high traffic load and its attendant noise pollution. Owing to its location between Offenbach and Hanau, there is quite a high load on BundesstraÃe 43. Running parallel to this for the most part is the busy Frankfurt-Fulda railway line, and MÃ¼hlheim also lies right on the approach to Frankfurt Airport.


Since 1995, MÃ¼hlheim has had at its disposal two S-Bahn stations: one in MÃ¼hlheim, which replaced the old MÃ¼hlheim station, and the other, newly built one in the outlying centre of Dietesheim. Both stations are served by Rhine-Main S-Bahn lines S8 and S9, putting downtown Offenbach only 5 minutes away, downtown Frankfurt 20 minutes away and Frankfurt Airport 35 minutes away. With the beginning of S-Bahn service, the town bus network was also brought into service, which, most importantly, linked the outlying centre of LÃ¤mmerspiel to the local public transport network.


Moreover, the Offenbach buslines 103, 107 and 120 come to and pass through MÃ¼hlheim.


The Maintal-DÃ¶rnigheim Ferry, a cable ferry across the Main, links MÃ¼hlheim with the DÃ¶rnigheim district of the town of Maintal on the opposite bank.


Among the local media is the daily newspaper Offenbach-Post. Complementing this is the monthly Die lokale Zeitung fÃ¼r MÃ¼hlheim, Dietesheim und LÃ¤mmerspiel (Zeitung means ânewspaperâ) with reports about people and events. There are, moreover, several advertising fliers. Reporting at greater length about MÃ¼hlheim are the weekly papers Dreieich-Zeitung and Stadtpost MÃ¼hlheim. Less often, reports about MÃ¼hlheim may be found in the local sections of the Frankfurter Rundschau. There is more often MÃ¼hlheim news in the Rhein-Main-Zeitung that comes with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.


MÃ¼hlheim has the following public schools:


In MÃ¼hlheim, the first â and thus far only â Montessori primary school in the Offenbach district has been open since 2006. At this school, which is sponsored privately, more than 40 pupils from the first to fourth school years are currently (August 2008) taught in mixed-age classes.


Also, a department of the Verwaltungsfachhochschule Wiesbaden (âWiesbaden Administration Technical Collegeâ), the Wiesbaden Police College, and the Police dog school in MÃ¼hlheim am Main are all resident.


Finally, MÃ¼hlheim is also home to a folk high school and a music school.


MÃ¼hlheim am Main is twinned with:


The composer Paul Hindemith attended a music school in MÃ¼hlheim during five years of his childhood. Here he learnt to play the violin from notes. Also, Napoleon supposedly once stayed here overnight in MÃ¼hlheim during a campaign.


Among honorary citizens are Bruno Polga, former mayor of the French partner town of St.-Priest, retired district chief (Landrat) Walter Schmitt (SPD), retired first councillor Horst Lehr (SPD), Reinhold Latzke (SPD) and Irmgard Sondergeld (CDU).


The MÃ¼hlentaler is an award given out by the town of MÃ¼hlheim to selected citizens who have served particularly well in shaping the town, for instance, through its clubs.


Moreover, there are the following awards and honours for those who have shown themselves worthy: the Ehrenurkunde (âCertificate of Honourâ), the Ehrenbrief der Stadt MÃ¼hlheim (âLetter of Honour of the Town of MÃ¼hlheimâ), the Ehrenplakette in Bronze (âBadge of Honour in Bronzeâ) and the Ehrenplakette in Silber (âBadge of Honour in Silverâ). It is the Magistrat (roughly, town executive) that decides whom to honour, except for the Ehrenplakette in Silber and the status of honorary citizen. The choice of recipients of these honours is determined by the full town council.",2,3 June 2006, 21 August 2021,80,0,0

A noodle-like pasta, it is made in thin ribbon strips.  A feature of this pasta is that it is kneaded for a long time.  It is cooked in beef (or sometimes sheep) broth and served with pecorino cheese.  In Busachi the pasta is flavoured with toasted saffron and ground to a powder.


Lisanzedas is a variant of pillus (and sometimes named as such) that is oven-baked in layers like lasagne.  The shape of the pasta is large (7 to 8 inches) diameter disks rather than ribbons.  It is the meat stew filling and the pecorino cheese that are the common factors rather than the shape of the pasta.  A variant of lisanzedas found around Cagliari is flavoured with saffron.  Another variant of this sort from Giba is flavoured with fennel.

The population was 48,445 at the 2010 census, up from 41,155 at the 2000 census. The city was one of the state's fastest growing in the 1980s and 1990s,[citation needed] beginning with 11,801 residents in 1980, doubling to 23,650 in 1990, 35,000 in 1995, and nearly double its 1990 population by 2000. A major center of growth in the Coachella Valley, Palm Desert is a popular retreat for ""snowbirds"" from colder climates (the Eastern and Northern United States, and Canada), who swell its population by an estimated 31,000 each winter. Palm Desert has seen more residents become ""full-timers"", mainly from the coasts and urban centers of California, who have come for both affordable and high-valued homes.


The ancestral homeland of Cahuilla, a division of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. Their bird songs and funeral songs share the oral tradition of how they were present on these lands for over 10,000 years. 


The area was first known as the Old MacDonald Ranch, but the name changed to Palm Village in the 1920s when date palms were planted. Local historians said the main residents of pre-1950 Palm Desert were Cahuilla Indian farmers of the now extinct San Cayetano tribe, but a few members of the Montoya family of Cahuilla/Spanish descent were prominent leaders in civic life.[citation needed]


The first residential development occurred in 1943 in connection with an Army maintenance camp in the area. That site was later developed into ""El Paseo"", an upscale shopping district not unlike Rodeo Drive. In 1948, the Palm Desert Corporation began to develop real estate, and in 1951 the area was given its present name.


According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 27.0 square miles (70Â km2), of which, 26.8 square miles (69Â km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52Â km2) of it (0.76%) is water.


The elevation (City hall) is 224 feet (68Â m) above sea level. Elevations vary from the lower northern half once covered in sand dunes to the upper slope southern cove (300â900 feet or 91â274 metres) all the way to the ridgeline at 1,000 feet (300Â m). Palm Desert is located in the Coachella Valley, the north-western extension of the Sonoran Desert.


Sun City Palm Desert, California lies on the northern side of Interstate 10 from Palm Desert itself, but is unincorporated and not part of the City of Palm Desert (the original name was Sun City Palm Springs from 1991 to 1996).


The climate of the Coachella Valley is influenced by the surrounding geography. High mountain ranges on three sides and a south-sloping valley floor all contribute to its year-round warm climate, having among the warmest winters in the western United States. Palm Desert has a tropical desert climate: Its average annual high temperature is 89Â Â°F (32Â Â°C) and average annual low is 62Â Â°F (17Â Â°C), but summer highs above 108Â Â°F (42Â Â°C) are common and sometimes exceed 120Â Â°F (49Â Â°C), while summer night lows often stay above 82Â Â°F (28Â Â°C). Winters are warm with daytime highs between 73â84Â Â°F (23â29Â Â°C). Under 5 inches (130Â mm) of annual precipitation are average, with over 348 days of sunshine per year. The mean annual temperature at 75.8Â Â°F (24.3Â Â°C) makes Palm Desert one of the warmest places in the United States. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Palm Desert was 125Â Â°F (52Â Â°C) on July 6, 1905. The surrounding mountains create a thermal belt in the southern foothills of Palm Desert, leading to a micro-climate with significantly warmer night-time temperatures during the winter months. The University of California maintains weather stations located in this thermal belt as part of their ecological project in the Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center.

Rapid growth and several annexations in the 1980s and 1990s have made Palm Desert a major shopping destination and the main center of business activity in the Coachella Valley.[citation needed] The city has evolved as a major shopping destination following the development of Westfield Palm Desert which opened in 1983. This development was followed by One Eleven Town Center, Town Center Plaza and Desert Crossing which included Target and other national anchors. The expansion of Fred Waring Drive into a six-lane thoroughfare has also encouraged new retail centers and commercial zones.


El Paseo Drive is downtown Palm Desert's main shopping street. The area around the street has evolved into an upscale shopping district featuring 150 boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants. El Paseo is often compared to Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive due to its concentration of posh retail outlets and lush landscaping.[citation needed] The street runs parallel to State Route 111, which serves as the main surface thoroughfare from Palm Springs to Indio.


The city's first golf course and tennis club was Shadow Mountain in 1952, followed by Marrakesh in 1954, the Palm Desert Greens mobile home park golf course in 1961, and the Palm Desert Country Club in 1962.

He was a longtime member with stints in the band from 1992â1995 and then again from 1999â2014.


He joined the band as the guitarist late 1991, and stayed until late 1994 when he left Cradle of Filth to join The Blood Divine. In 1998 Paul Allender started another band called Primary Slave. In 2000, just before Primary Slave signed a recording contract, he rejoined Cradle of Filth on the band's album, Midian after receiving a call from Dani Filth, along with drummer Adrian Erlandsson and keyboardist Martin Powell.


As of April 2014 Paul Allender has once again left Cradle of Filth.


Paul Allender is recognised for his unique right-handed technique and is currently endorsed by PRS Guitars, RotoSound and Blackstar amplification. 


""To tell you the truth... I don't jam. I've always played what actually I see in my head. Therefore, when I play, I don't use any specific scales or anything in order or that's musically correct or anything... Iâve always concentrated on mixing lead-oriented riffs, but in like a rhythmic sense. That's the way I've always been because I've never really been interested in doing ultra-fast lead work. I've always mixed the two up. Just concentrating on the 16th notes and stuff on the right hand, making sure it all sinks in. It's the guitar and it's the way we dress onstage, it's all part of this troupe, this uniformed-like togetherness... It just comes out dark as fuck"".


Allender also has an art side project known as ""Vomitorium: The Dark Art Of Cindy Frey And Paul Allender"". He also produced the artwork for New Project's debut album Ultraviolent Light.[citation needed]



In 2013, Allender was involved with the formation of a new project named ""White Empress"".

Paul and I actually have a number of mutual friends and acquaintances and it was Melissa Ferlaak of Plague of Stars (formerly of Visions of Atlantis, Aesma Daeva, Echoterra) who put us in touch with each other. We talked about working on some new music together and he set me the instrumental tracks he'd been working on. They were phenomenal and I decided to lay down vocals for 3 songs. Everything went really well together and we made an official band. White Empress is really all about the concept of ""The Empress"". The entire band is in essence ""The Empress"". She's her own creative concept, her own image, her own identity that comes from all of us in the band (meaning I'm not the Empress, necessarily). White Empress is an entire band with a fantasy avatar. It's visual and audio all tied into one huge concept. The band is fantastic, we all contribute equally to the creative process and we've come up with some amazing things for everyone. The Empress is Coming!!

  An EP was released in January 2014. Their debut album - Rise of the Empress - was released through Peaceville Records on 29 September 2014. It was initially funded through a Pledge Music campaign.


In 2016, Allender changed the direction of the project, removing all of the singing and replacing it with narration. The band then had the style of a horror audiobook with cinematic film.  White Empress released the single ""Revenant"" in 2016, and then went on indefinite hiatus.",2,5 March 2005, 11 April 2021,369,0,0

1014250,Degeneration theory,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration_theory,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degeneration_theory&action=info,"Social degeneration was a widely influential concept at the interface of the social and biological sciences in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 18th century, scientific thinkers including George Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, and Immanuel Kant argued that humans shared a common origin but had degenerated over time due to differences in climate. This theory provided an explanation of where humans came from and why some people appeared different from others. In contrast, degenerationists in the 19th century feared that civilization might be in decline and that the causes of decline lay in biological change. These ideas derived from pre-scientific concepts of heredity (""hereditary taint"") with Lamarckian emphasis on biological development through purpose and habit. Degeneration concepts were often associated with authoritarian political attitudes, including militarism and scientific racism, and a preoccupation with eugenics. The theory originated in racial concepts of ethnicity, recorded in the writings of such medical scientists as Johann Blumenbach and Robert Knox. From the 1850s, it became influential in psychiatry through the writings of BÃ©nÃ©dict Morel, and in  criminology with Cesare Lombroso. By the 1890s, in the work of Max Nordau and others, degeneration became a more general concept in social criticism. It also fed into the ideology of ethnic nationalism, attracting, among others, Maurice BarrÃ¨s, Charles Maurras and the Action FranÃ§aise.  Alexis Carrel, a French Nobel Laureate in Medicine, cited national degeneration as a rationale for a eugenics programme in collaborationist Vichy France.


The meaning of degeneration was poorly defined, but can be described as an organism's change from a more complex to a simpler, less differentiated form, and is associated with 19th-century conceptions of biological devolution. In scientific usage, the term was reserved for changes occurring at a histological level â i.e. in body tissues. Although rejected by Charles Darwin, the theory's application to the social sciences was supported by some evolutionary biologists, most notably Ernst Haeckel and Ray Lankester. As the 19th century wore on, the increasing emphasis on degeneration reflected an anxious pessimism about the resilience of European civilization and its possible decline and collapse.[citation needed]


In the second half of the eighteenth century, degeneration theory gained prominence as an explanation of the nature and origin of human difference. Among the most notable proponents of this theory was George Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon. A gifted mathematician and eager naturalist, Buffon served as the curator of the Parisian Cabinet du Roi. The collections of the Cabinet du Roi served as the inspiration for Buffon's encyclopedic Histoire Naturelle, of which he published thirty-six volumes between 1749 and his death in 1788. In the Histoire Naturelle, Buffon asserted that differences in climate created variety within species. He believed that these changes occurred gradually and initially affected only a few individuals before becoming widespread. Buffon relied on an argument from analogy to contend that this process of degeneration occurred among humans. He claimed to have observed the transformation of certain animals by their climate and concluded that such changes must have also shaped humankind.


Buffon maintained that degeneration had particularly adverse consequences in the New World. He believed America to be both colder and wetter than Europe. This climate limited the number of species in the New World and prompted a decline in size and vigor among the animals which did survive. Buffon also applied these principles to the people of the New World. He wrote in the Histoire Naturelle that the indigenous people lacked the ability to feel strong emotion for others. For Buffon, these individuals were incapable of love as well as desire.


Buffon's theory of degeneration attracted the ire of many early American elites who feared that Buffon's depiction of the New World would negatively influence European perceptions of their nation. In particular, Thomas Jefferson mounted a vigorous defense of the American natural world. He attacked the premises of Buffon's argument in his 1785 Notes on the State of Virginia, writing that the animals of the New World felt the same sun and walked upon the same soil as their European counterparts. Jefferson believed that he could permanently alter Buffon's views of the New World by showing him firsthand the majesty of American wildlife. While serving as minister to France, Jefferson wrote repeatedly to his compatriots in the United States, pleading them to send a stuffed moose to Paris. After months of effort, General John Sullivan responded to Jefferson's request and shipped a moose to France. Buffon died only three months after the moose's arrival, and his theory of New World degeneration remained forever preserved in the pages of the Histoire Naturelle.


In the years following Buffon's death, the theory of degeneration gained a number of new followers, many of whom were concentrated in German-speaking lands. The anatomist and naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach praised Buffon in his lectures at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. He adopted Buffon's theory of degeneration in his dissertation De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa. The central premise of this work was that all of mankind belonged to the same species. Blumenbach believed that a multitude of factors, including climate, air, and the strength of the sun, promoted degeneration and resulted in external differences between human beings. However, he also asserted that these changes could easily be undone and, thus, did not constitute the basis for speciation. In the essay âÃber Menschen-Rassen und Schweine-Rassen,â Blumenbach clarified his understanding of the relationship between different human races by calling upon the example of the pig. He contended that, if the domestic pig and the wild boar were seen as belonging to the same species, then different humans, regardless of skin color or height, must too belong to the same species. For Blumenbach, all people of the world existed as different gradations on a spectrum. Nevertheless, the third edition of De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa, published in 1795, is famed among scholars for its introduction of a system of racial classification which divided humans into members of the Caucasian, Ethiopian, Mongolian, Malayan, or American races.


Blumenbach's views on degeneration emerged in dialogue with the works of other thinkers concerned with race and origin in the late eighteenth century. In particular, Blumenbach participated in fruitful intellectual exchange with another prominent German scholar of his age, Immanuel Kant. Kant, a philosopher and professor at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg, taught a course on physical geography for some forty years, fostering an interest in biology and taxonomy. Like Blumenbach, Kant engaged closely with the writings of Buffon while developing his position on these subjects.


In his 1777 essay âVon der verschiedenen Racen der Menschen,â Kant expressed the belief that all humans shared a common origin. He called upon the ability of humans to interbreed as evidence for this assertion. Additionally, Kant introduced the term âdegeneration,â which he defined as hereditary differences between groups with a shared root.  Kant also arrived at a meaning of âraceâ from this definition of degeneration. He claimed that races developed when degenerations were preserved over a long period of time. A group could only constitute a race if breeding with a different degeneration resulted in âintermediate offspring."" Although Kant advocated for a theory of shared human origin, he also contended that there was an innate hierarchy between existing races. In 1788, Kant wrote âÃber den Gebrauch teleologischer Prinzipien.â He maintained in this work that a human's place in nature was determined by the amount of sweat the individual produced, which revealed an innate ability to survive. Sweat emerged from the skin. Therefore, skin color indicated important distinctions between humans.


The concept of degeneration arose during the European enlightenment and the industrial revolution â a period of profound social change and a rapidly shifting sense of personal identity. Several influences were involved.


The first related to the extreme demographic upheavals, including urbanization, in the early years of the 19th century. The disturbing experience of social change and urban crowds, largely unknown in the agrarian 18th century, was recorded in the journalism of William Cobbett, the novels of Charles Dickens and in the paintings of J M W Turner. These changes were also explored by early writers on social psychology, including Gustav Le Bon and Georg Simmel. The psychological impact of industrialisation is comprehensively described in Humphrey Jennings' masterly anthology Pandaemonium 1660 - 1886. Victorian social reformers including Edwin Chadwick, Henry Mayhew and Charles Booth voiced realistic concerns about the decline of public health in the urban life of the British working class (urban squalor), arguing for improved housing and sanitation, access to parks and recreational facilities, an improved diet and a reduction in alcohol intake. These contributions from the public health perspective were discussed by the Scottish physician Sir James Cantlie in his influential 1885 lecture Degeneration Amongst Londoners. The novel experience of everyday contact with the urban working classes gave rise to a kind of horrified fascination with their perceived reproductive energies which appeared to threaten middle-class culture.


Secondly, the proto-evolutionary biology and transformatist speculations of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and other natural historiansâtaken together with the Baron von Cuvier's theory of extinctionsâplayed an important part in establishing a sense of the unsettled aspects of the natural world. The polygenic theories of multiple human origins, supported by Robert Knox in his book The Races of Men (1850), were firmly rejected by Charles Darwin who, following James Cowles Prichard, generally agreed on a single African origin for the entire human species.


Thirdly, the development of world trade and colonialism, the early European experience of globalization, resulted in an awareness of the varieties of cultural expression and the vulnerabilities of Western civilization.


Finally, the growth of historical scholarship in the 18th century, exemplified by Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (1776â1789), excited a renewed interest in the narratives of historical decline. This resonated uncomfortably with the difficulties of French political life in the post-revolutionary nineteenth century.


Degeneration theory achieved a detailed articulation in BÃ©nÃ©dict Morel's Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species (1857), a complicated work of clinical commentary from an asylum in Normandy (Saint Yon in Rouen) which, in the popular imagination at least, coalesced with de Gobineau's Essay on The Inequality of the Human Races (1855). Morel's concept of mental degeneration â in which he believed that intoxication and addiction in one generation of a family would lead to hysteria, epilepsy, sexual perversions, insanity, learning disability and sterility in subsequent generations â is an example of Lamarckian biological thinking, and Morel's medical discussions are reminiscent of the clinical literature surrounding syphilitic infection (syphilography). Morel's psychiatric theories were taken up and advocated by his friend Philippe Buchez, and through his political influence became an official doctrine in French legal and administrative medicine.


Arthur de Gobineau came from an impoverished family (with a domineering and adulterous mother) which claimed an aristocratic ancestry; he was a failed author of historical romances, and his wife was widely rumored to be a CrÃ©ole from Martinique. De Gobineau nevertheless argued that the course of history and civilization was largely determined by ethnic factors, and that interracial marriage (""miscegenation"") resulted in social chaos. De Gobineau built a successful career in the French diplomatic service, living for extended periods in Iran and Brazil, and spent his later years travelling through Europe, lamenting his mistreatment at the hands of his wife and daughters. He died of a heart attack in 1882 while boarding a train in Turin. His work was well received in German translationânot least by the composer Richard Wagnerâand the leading German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin later wrote extensively on the dangers posed by degeneration to the German people. De Gobineau's writings exerted an enormous influence on the thinkers antecedent to the Third Reich â although they are curiously free of anti-Semitic prejudice. Quite different historical factors inspired the Italian Cesare Lombroso in his work on criminal anthropology with the notion of atavistic retrogression, probably shaped by his experiences as a young army doctor in Calabria during the  risorgimento.


In England, degeneration received a scientific formulation from Ray Lankester whose detailed discussions of the biology of parasitism were hugely influential; and the poor physical condition of many recruits for the second South African war (1899â1902) caused alarm in British government circles. The psychiatrist Henry Maudsley initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little social consequence, but later became more pessimistic about the effects of degeneration on the general population; Maudsley also warned against the use of the term ""degeneration"" in a vague and indiscriminate way. British anxieties about the perils of degeneration found legislative expression in the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 which had the strong support of Winston Churchill, then a senior member of the Liberal government.


In the fin-de-siÃ¨cle period, Max Nordau scored an unexpected success with his bestselling Degeneration (1892). Sigmund Freud met Nordau in 1885 while he was studying in Paris and was notably unimpressed by him and hostile to the degeneration concept. Degeneration fell from popular and fashionable favor around the time of the First World War, although some of its preoccupations persisted in the writings of the eugenicists and social Darwinists (for example, R. Austin Freeman; Anthony Ludovici; Rolf Gardiner; and see also Dennis Wheatley's Letter to posterity). Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West (1919) captured something of the degenerationist spirit in the aftermath of the war.


Degeneration theory is, at its heart, a way of thinking, and something that is taught, not innate. A major influence on the theory was Emil Kraepelin, lining up degeneration theory with his psychiatry practice. The central idea of this concept was that in âdegenerativeâ illness, there is a steady decline in mental functioning and social adaptation from one generation to the other. For example, there might be an intergenerational development from nervous character to major depressive disorder, to overt psychotic illness and, finally, to severe and chronic cognitive impairment, something akin to dementia. This theory was advanced decades before the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics and their application to medicine in general and to psychiatry in particular. Kraepelin and his colleagues mostly derived from degeneration theory broadly. He rarely made a specific references to the theory of degeneration, and his attitude towards degeneration theory was not straightforward. Positive, but more ambivalent. The concept of disease, especially chronic mental disease fit very well into this framework insofar these phenomena were regarded as signs of an evolution in the wrong direction, as a degenerative process which diverts from the usual path of nature.


However, he remainedÂ skeptical of over-simplistic versions of this concept: While commenting approvingly on the basic ideas of Cesare Lombroso's âcriminal anthropology,â he did not accept the popular idea of overt âstigmata degenerationsâ, by which individual persons could be identified as being âdegeneratedâ simply by their physical appearance. While Kraepelin and his colleagues may not have focused on this, it did not stop others from advancing the converse idea.


An early application of this theory was the Mental Deficiency Act supported by Winston Churchill in 1913. This entailed placing those deemed âidiotsâ into separate colonies, or anyone who showed sign of a âdegenerationâ. While this did apply to those with mental disorders of a psychiatric nature, the execution was not always in the same vein, as some of the language was used to the those âmorally weakâ, or deemed âidiotsâ. The belief in the existence of degeneration helped foster a sense that a sense of negative energy was inexplicable and was there to find sources of ârotâ in society.Â This forwarded the notion the idea that society wasÂ  structured in a way that produced regression, an outcome of the âdarker side of progressâ.


Those who had developed the label of ""degenerate"" as a means of qualifying difference in a negative manner could use the idea that this âdarker side of progressâ was inevitable by having the idea society could ârot"". Considerations to the pervasiveness an allegedly superior condition were, during the nineteenth century, frighteningly reinforced the language and habits of destructive thinking.


The idea of progress was at once a social, political and scientific theory. The theory of evolution, as described in Darwin's The Origin of Species, provided for many social theorists the necessary scientific foundation for the idea of social and political progress. The terms evolution and progress were in fact often used interchangeably in the 19th century.


The rapid industrial, political and economic progress in 19th-century Europe and North America was, however, paralleled by a sustained discussion about increasing rates of crime, insanity, vagrancy, prostitution, and so forth. Confronted with this apparent paradox, evolutionary scientists, criminal anthropologists and psychiatrists postulated that civilization and scientific progress could be a cause of physical and social pathology as much as a defense against it.Â This led to the emergence of a general theory of degeneration, never reduced to a concrete, simple theory or axiom. Instead, the concept of degeneration was produced and refined within and between several discourses, including the human sciences, the natural sciences, fictional narratives and socio-political commentaries. A broad outline of the theory, however, can be formulated, and it runs as follows.


According to the theory of degeneration, a host of individual and social pathologies in a finite network of diseases, disorders and moral habits could be explained by a biologically based affliction. The primary symptoms of the affliction were thought to be a weakening of the vital forces and will power of its victim. In this way, a wide range of social and medical deviations, including crime, violence, alcoholism, prostitution, gambling, and pornography, could be explained by reference to a biological defect within the individual. The theory of degeneration was therefore predicated on evolutionary theory. The forces of degeneration opposed those of evolution, and those afflicted with degeneration were thought to represent a return to an earlier evolutionary stage.  This can be seen socially when mixed race marriages started becoming more frequent as the 19th century progressed. Such mixed marriages, all but unthinkable in 1848 but now on the rise among Indo-European and even full-blood European women with native men, were attributed to the increasing impoverishment and declining welfare of these women on the one hand an ""intellectual and social development"" among certain classes of native the other. The issue, however, was rarely addressed since the gender hierarchy of the argument was contingent on assuming those who made such conjugal choices were neither well-bred nor deserved European standing. As more peopleÂ  began to mix with a race or people that was seen as lesser, degeneration theory became intertwined with development in a racial and colonial sense and more of these examples became common.


The poetics of degeneration was a poetics of social crisis. In the last decades of the century; Victorian social planners drew deeply on social Darwinism and the idea of degeneration to figure the social crises erupting relentlessly in the cities and colonies. Heightened debates converged with domestic and colonial social reform, cementing an offensive of a somewhat different order. It targeted the ""dangerous"" in paupered residuum and the growing population impoverished Indo-Europeans, the majority of whom were of mixed but legally classified as European.Â The world, being more globalized than ever before, continued to have more âcrisesâ similar to these had by the leading classes, deterring the other as the enemy or downfall of society.


By the end of the 1870s, Britain was foundering in severe depression, and throughout the 1880s class insurgency; feminist upheavals, the socialist revival, swelling poverty and the dearth of housing and jobs fed deepening middle class fears.


   ""The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of that blood....in fact, the man of a decadent time, the degenerate man properly so-called, is a different being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages....I think I am right in concluding that the human race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood...."" Arthur de Gobineau (1855) Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races.

 ""When under any kind of noxious influence an organism becomes debilitated, its successors will not resemble the healthy, normal type of the species, with capacities for development, but will form a new sub-species, which, like all others, possesses the capacity of transmitting to its offspring, in a continuously increasing degree, its peculiarities, these being morbid deviations from the normal form - gaps in development, malformations and infirmities..."" BÃ©nÃ©dict Morel (1857) Treatise on Degeneration.

 ""...Any new set of conditions which renders a species' food and safety very easily obtained, seems to lead to degeneration...."" Ray Lankester (1880) Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism.

 ""We stand now in the midst of a severe mental epidemic; of a sort of black death of degeneration and hysteria, and it is natural that we should ask anxiously on all sides: 'What is to come nextÂ ?' "" Max Nordau (1892) Degeneration.

 ""It has become the fashion to regard any symptom which is not obviously due to trauma or infection as a sign of degeneracy....this being so, it may well be asked whether an attribution of ""degeneracy"" is of any value, or adds anything to our knowledge..."" Sigmund Freud (1905) Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality.

The earliest uses of the term degeneration can be found in the writings of Blumenbach and Buffon at the end of the 18th century, when these early writers on natural history considered scientific approaches to the human species. With the taxonomic mind-set of natural historians, they drew attention to the different ethnic groupings of mankind, and raised general enquiries about their relationships, with the idea that racial groupings could be explained by environmental effects on a common ancestral stock. This pre-Darwinian belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics does not accord with modern genetics. An alternative view of the multiple origins of different racial groups, called ""polygenic theories"", was also rejected by Charles Darwin, who favored explanations in terms of differential geographic migrations from a single, probably African, population.


The theory of degeneration found its first detailed presentation in the writings of BÃ©nÃ©dict Morel (1809â1873), especially in his TraitÃ© des dÃ©gÃ©nÃ©rescences physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'espÃ¨ce humaine (Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species) (1857). This book was published two years before Darwin's Origin of Species. Morel was a highly regarded psychiatrist, the very successful superintendent of the Rouen asylum for almost twenty years and a fastidious recorder of the family histories of his variously disabled patients. Through the details of these family histories, Morel discerned an hereditary line of defective parents infected by pollutants and stimulants; a second generation liable to epilepsy, neurasthenia, sexual deviations and hysteria; a third generation prone to insanity; and a final generation doomed to congenital idiocy and sterility. In 1857, Morel proposed a theory of hereditary degeneracy, bringing together environmental and hereditary elements in an uncompromisingly pre-Darwinian mix. Morel's contribution was further developed by Valentin Magnan (1835â1916), who stressed the role of alcoholâparticularly absintheâin the generation of psychiatric disorders.


Morel's ideas were greatly extended by the Italian medical scientist Cesare Lombroso (1835â1909) whose work was defended and translated into English by Havelock Ellis. In his L'uomo delinquente (1876), Lombroso outlined a comprehensive natural history of the socially deviant person and detailed the stigmata of the person who was born to be criminally insane. These included a low, sloping forehead, hard and shifty eyes, large, handle-shaped ears, a flattened or upturned nose, a forward projection of the jaw, irregular teeth, prehensile toes and feet, long simian arms and a scanty beard and baldness. Lombroso also listed the features of the degenerate mentality, supposedly released by the disinhibition of the primitive neurological centres. These included apathy, the loss of moral sense, a tendency to impulsiveness or self-doubt, an unevenness of mental qualities such as unusual memory or aesthetic abilities, a tendency to mutism or to verbosity, excessive originality, preoccupation with the self, mystical interpretations placed on simple facts or perceptions, the abuse of symbolic meanings and the magical use of words, or mantras. Lombroso, with his concept of atavistic retrogression, suggested an evolutionary reversion, complementing hereditary degeneracy, and his work in the medical examination of criminals in Turin resulted in his theory of criminal anthropologyâa constitutional notion of abnormal personality that was not actually supported by his own scientific investigations. In his later life, Lombroso developed an obsession with spiritualism, engaging with the spirit of his long dead mother.


In 1892, Max Nordau, an expatriate Hungarian living in Paris, published his extraordinary bestseller Degeneration, which greatly extended the concepts of BÃ©nÃ©dict Morel and Cesare Lombroso (to whom he dedicated the book) to the entire civilization of western Europe, and transformed the medical connotations of degeneration into a generalized cultural criticism. Adopting some of Charcot's neurological vocabulary, Nordau identified a number of weaknesses in contemporary Western culture which he characterized in terms of ego-mania, i.e., narcissism and hysteria. He also emphasized the importance of fatigue, enervation and ennui. Nordau, horrified by the anti-Semitism surrounding the Dreyfus affair, devoted his later years to Zionist politics. Degeneration theory fell from favour around the time of the First World War because of an improved understanding of the mechanisms of genetics as well as the increasing vogue for psychoanalytic thinking. However, some of its preoccupations lived on in the world of eugenics and social Darwinism. It is notable that the Nazi attack on western liberal society was largely couched in terms of degenerate art with its associations of racial miscegenation and fantasies of racial purityâand included as its target almost all modernist cultural experiment.


The role of women in furthering development of the concept of degeneration was reviewed by Anne McClintock, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin, who found that women who were ambiguously placed on the so-called ""imperial divide"" (nurses, nannies, governesses, prostitutes and servants) happened to serve as boundary markers and mediators. These women were tasked with the purification and maintenance of boundaries and what was seen as ""inferior"" places in society they held at the time.


Towards the close of the 19th century, in the fin-de-siÃ¨cle period, something of an obsession with decline, descent and degeneration invaded the European creative imagination, partly fuelled by widespread misconceptions of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Among the main examples are the symbolist literary work of Charles Baudelaire, the Rougon-Macquart novels of Ãmile Zola, Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hydeâpublished in the same year (1886) as Richard von Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualisâand, subsequently, Oscar Wilde's only novel (containing his aesthetic manifesto) The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891). In Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), Thomas Hardy explores the destructive consequences of a family myth of noble ancestry. Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen showed a sensitivity to degenerationist thinking in his theatrical presentations of Scandinavian domestic crises. Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan (1890/1894), with its emphasis on the horrors of psychosurgery, is frequently cited as an essay on degeneration.  A scientific twist was added by H.G. Wells in The Time Machine (1895) in which Wells prophesied the splitting of the human race into variously degenerate forms, and again in his The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896) wherein forcibly mutated animal-human hybrids keep reverting to their earlier forms. Joseph Conrad alludes to degeneration theory in his treatment of political radicalism in the 1907 novel The Secret Agent.


In her influential study The Gothic Body, Kelly Hurley draws attention to the literary device of the abhuman as a representation of damaged personal identity, and to lesser-known authors in the field, including Richard Marsh (1857â1915), author of The Beetle (1897), and William Hope Hodgson (1877â1918), author of The Boats of the Glen Carrig, The House on the Borderland and The Night Land. In 1897, Bram Stoker published Dracula, an enormously influential Gothic novel featuring the parasitic vampire Count Dracula in an extended exercise of reversed imperialism. Unusually, Stoker makes explicit reference to the writings of Lombroso and Nordau in the course of the novel.

3726446,2005 Tri Nations Series,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Tri_Nations_Series,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2005_Tri_Nations_Series&action=info,"The 2005 Tri Nations Series, an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, was the tenth in the series. The competition is organised by SANZAR, a consortium of the three countries' rugby federations. This was the last year in which the Tri Nations was contested in its original double round-robin format, with each team playing the others twice.


The All Blacks won the competition, with the key being a nail-biting 31â27 win over the South Africa Springboks at Carisbrook in Dunedin. The All Blacks also retained the Bledisloe Cup by sweeping the Australia Wallabies in both fixtures. The Mandela Challenge Plate between Australia and South Africa was contested outside the Tri Nations.


The All Blacks were clear favourites going in, having come off a sweep of the British & Irish Lions. The Springboks entered with many questions, most dealing with the player selections made by coach Jake White. Many in South Africa questioned White's selections after a loss to Australia in the first leg of the Mandela Plate. However, the Springboks won the second leg to retain the Mandela Plate. The Wallabies entered with promise, but had been hurt by the loss of talismanic fly-half Stephen Larkham to a shoulder injury before the series.


The series began with the South Africa leg. In the opener, the Springboks came from behind to defeat the Wallabies at Loftus Versfeld. The 22â16 margin gave the Wallabies the consolation of a bonus point. The following week at Newlands, the Boks handed the All Blacks what would prove to be their only loss in 2005 by the identical score.


When the series moved to Australia, the All Blacks ensured themselves of retaining the Bledisloe Cup by a comprehensive 30â13 win over the Wallabies. However, they failed to earn a bonus point. The Springboks kept pace with the All Blacks by nipping Australia the following week 22â19.


The series decider proved to be the first match of the New Zealand leg, pitting the All Blacks and Springboks. In a closely fought match, a late try by Keven Mealamu gave the All Blacks both the win and a key bonus point. They would secure the trophy the next week with a bonus-point win over the Wallabies.


The All Blacks emerged from the Tri Nations as clearly the best team in the world in 2005. They had enough depth to shrug off what would have been a devastating loss to most other national teamsâan injury to arguably their best player, fly-half Daniel Carter during the win in Sydney, that kept him out of the tests at home against the Springboks and the Wallabies. The All Blacks would punctuate their season with a ""Grand Slam"" over all four Home Nations on their November tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Carter would come back for the Grand Slam tour, and was selected as 2005 World Player of the Year by the International Rugby Board.


As for the Springboks, they showed themselves to be a close second to the All Blacks, silencing White's critics in the process. For the second straight year, the Tri Nations was the international coming-out party for a young Springboks star. In 2004, Schalk Burger, Jean de Villiers and Marius Joubert emerged as major stars, with Burger going on to be named the IRB World Player of the Year. This year, Bryan Habana established himself as one of the world's most dangerous wings, and was named a finalist for World Player of the Year.


The Wallabies fought bravely throughout the series, but were ultimately outmanned. The competition exposed major weaknesses in their front row. They would spiral downward to their longest Test losing streak since 1969, which would cost head coach Eddie Jones his job.


As in past competitions, points were earned on the following schedule:

55655661,Byron Bay Train,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Bay_Train,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byron_Bay_Train&action=info,"The Byron Bay Train is a not-for-profit passenger rail service in Byron Bay, New South Wales. Since commencing in December 2017, it operates on a three-kilometre section of the disused Casino-Murwillumbah line.


A 1949-built 600 class railcar was converted to solar power for use on the service.


The first section of the Murwillumbah line (which the Byron Bay Train uses) opened between Lismore and Murwillumbah, connecting the Richmond and Tweed rivers. Passengers and goods were transported to Sydney by coastal shipping from Byron Bay. Nine years later, an extension from Lismore to Casino opened (and later south to Grafton â it was not until 1932 that the line was fully connected to Sydney). The line became a branch line when in 1930, the North Coast line was extended from Kyogle to South Brisbane. The Casino-Murwillumbah railway was closed in 2004, with the last NSW CountryLink XPT train leaving Murwillumbah on 15 May 2004. 


The section of track to the north of the town centre was fully restored by private investment at a cost of about $300,000 per kilometre. Track work on the section commenced on 23 May 2016 and was completed in late November that year. New platforms and a storage shed were completed in April 2017. It was confirmed in early January 2017, the train would run on solar-hybrid operation. The solar service is believed to be a world first.


Operations commenced on 16 December 2017. The service carried over 10,000 passengers in its first 19 days. One year later in January 2019, the train carried its 100,000th passenger.


The Byron Bay Railroad Company operates a single railmotor. Power car 661, along with trailer 761, was built at Chullora Railway Workshops in 1949 as 601/701. In 1973, it was upgraded with its GM Detroit Diesel 6/71 engines replaced with Cummins NT855-R2 engines and was subsequently renumbered 661/761. Withdrawn by the State Rail Authority in the early 1990s, it was sold to the Lithgow State Mine Heritage Park & Railway.


After 761 was destroyed by a bushfire, the 1960s-built trailer 726 was acquired as a replacement. It was restored to service in 2015 and operated a few charters on the Gwabegar line to Rylstone and Main Western line to Tarana. In 2017, it was converted to solar-hybrid operation. The conversion was completed in October 2017, and the railmotor was moved from Lithgow by road, arriving on 3 November 2017. Electricity will be supplied from the grid when there is insufficient solar and the train is intended to run on diesel fuel about once a week.


The railmotor has a seating capacity of 100 people. It is believed to be the world's first solar-powered train.


The train operates a return shuttle between North Beach station located in Sunrise Beach and Byron Beach station, which serves the beach and Byron township. Due to the service not being subsidised by the government, the timetable will be reviewed from time to time. The train contains room for bikes, prams and surfboards, which can be carried free of charge. It does not use the existing station as this would have required the reinstatement of a level crossing.


The North Beach station is located on Bayshore Drive, near the Sun Bistro Tavern and Elements of Byron Resort. The Byron Beach station is located on the northern side of the Lawson Street level crossing in the Byron Bay CBD.


Passengers aged 0â5 years ride free, with those aged 6â13 travelling for $2, and passengers fourteen and up travelling for $4 on a one-way journey. A 10-ride adult ticket is available for $27.",1,29 October 2017, 31 August 2021,76,1,1
61190162,Sir Samuel McClellan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Samuel_McClellan,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sir_Samuel_McClellan&action=info,"Sir Samuel McClellan, MacClellan or McLellan (c. 1640â1709) was a Scottish cloth merchant and politician who sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1708 to 1709. He served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1706 to 1708.  


McClellan was descended from the McClellans of Raeberry Castle near Bomby in Kirkcudbright. He was the eldest son of Rev Patrick McClellan (died 1666) of  Girthon  near Kirkcudbright and his wife Jean Primrose. He was apprenticed to Robert Douglas, an Edinburgh merchant, and after Douglas died in 1679, he was admitted as a burgess of Edinburgh in his own right. MacClellan retained some interest during the 1670s in property in the stewartry (in 1676 he is recorded as owner of the Tannifad and Whinniehill farm estates)  but he focused his attention  on Edinburgh. In 1681, he invested Â£100 in the new cloth manufactory at the Newmills Cloth Manufactory at Amisfield Haddington, east of Edinburgh. With an employment force of 700, it was one of the largest factories in all Scotland. He and his partners secured a series of important contracts for military uniforms.  In 1690 he received a lucrative contract for 647 military red coats from Alexander Gordon, Viscount Kenmure, replacing uniforms damaged in the Battle of Killiecrankie.


McLellan was treasurer to Kirk sessions at Edinburgh in 1690, and a merchant councillor from 1692 to 1693. He was baron bailie for Leith in 1693 and old bailie in 1695. By 1694, he married Marjorie Thomson. From 1696 to 1698, he was treasurer for the city. In 1696 he bought shares in the ill-fated Company of Scotland, also buying Â£3000 on behalf of the City of Edinburgh probably  in his capacity as City Treasurer. However, despite investment he was not an official company member.


In 1697 McLellan took over the stewart and justiciar, Orkney and Shetland, Stewartry of Orkney, supplying goods to the island, and ensuring such supply from others.  In 1702, he was old dean of guild and became a  magistrate in 1704. He was dean of guild in 1705 and in 1706 was elected Lord Provost of Edinburgh in succession to Sir Patrick Johnston at Michaelmas 1706. Johnston rather than McClellan was the broker of the Act of Union 1707, but McClellan, as a major investor in the Company of Scotland, received compensation for his losses in the company under the terms of agreement of the Act of Union.


McLellan was burgess of Perth in 1708, and at the 1708 British general election,  was returned as Member of Parliament for  Edinburgh. He was given a detailed set of instructions from his constituents and was voted Â£300 for expenses in London.  The convention of royal burghs also promised him Â£100 to promote their interests. At Michaelmas 1708, he was succeeded as Lord Provost by Johnston, who  returned to office after a period of self-imposed exile. His record in Parliament does show much activity, and he did not meet any of his constituent's objectives, but he claimed an additional sum of Â£106 7s. 2d in expenses. He also looked after his own interests while in London. He gave financial inducements to Robert Walpole   and Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet, to secure Scottish forage contracts.


McLellan died on 22 September 1709 leaving three sons and four daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, James, who subsequently made an abortive bid for the barony of Kirkcudbright, claiming to be the nearest male heir to a peerage that had failed in its main line. He was father of P. MacLellan (Patrick?), who is noted as a donor to the Orphan Hospital in 1770. and was grandfather to William McClellan, 6th Lord Kirkcudbright.


His deals for forage contracts were  censured in the report of the public accounts commissioners on 21 December 1711. The New Mills factory was auctioned in 1712 following his death.


His brother Robert McClellan of Barmachagan fought at the Battle of Rullion Green in 1666. After several years in hiding he returned as a Captain fighting at the Battle of Drumclog and Battle of Bothwell Brig. He was banished from Scotland in 1685 and sent (as a punishment) to New Jersey. Robert's son (Samuel's nephew) also Robert (died 1717) became a tobacco merchant trading between America and Glasgow.",1,1 July 2019, 16 August 2021,8,0,0

The era of skyscrapers in India began with the completion of the LIC Building in Chennai in 1959. With 12 floors initially, it was the first skyscraper in the country and remained the tallest building in the country until 1961 when it was surpassed by the 25-storied Usha Kiran Building in Mumbai. Many taller buildings appeared in various cities in the country ever since. Palais Royale structurally topped out in 2018 is the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters but currently the building is on-hold due to some legal obligations. World One at 280.2 metres (919 feet) and 76 floors is the tallest completed building in the country currently which will be replaced by Supertech Supernova Spira constructed in Noida in the upcoming times.

53893331,Dubravka Filipovski,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubravka_Filipovski,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dubravka_Filipovski&action=info,"Dubravka Filipovski (Serbian Cyrillic: ÐÑÐ±ÑÐ°Ð²ÐºÐ° Ð¤Ð¸Ð»Ð¸Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐºÐ¸; born January 27, 1967), nÃ©e ÄekanoviÄ (Serbian Cyrillic: Ð§ÐµÐºÐ°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ) is a politician in Serbia. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2012. Previously a member of New Serbia, Filipovski has been a member of the Serbian Progressive Party since November 2017.


Filipovski was born in Novi Pazar, in the SandÅ¾ak region of what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She is a graduate of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy, and from 1992 to 1994 she was an assistant in the university's department of adult education. She worked in the private sector from 1994 to 2004.


Filipovski joined New Serbia in 2004 and was appointed as a party spokesperson later in the same year. She appeared on the party's electoral list for the City Assembly of Belgrade in the 2004 Serbian local elections. The list did not cross the electoral threshold to win any mandates. In November 2005, she was chosen as a party vice-chair.


New Serbia contested both the 2007 and 2008 parliamentary elections in an alliance with the Democratic Party of Serbia; Filipovski received the eighth position on the coalition's electoral list in each instance, although she did not take a seat in parliament on either occasion. She also received the eighth position on the coalition's list for the Belgrade city assembly in the 2008 local elections. The list won twelve mandates, though she did not take a seat in the city assembly either. (From 2000 to 2011, mandates in Serbian elections were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order.)


In July 2007, Serbian president Boris TadiÄ offered an apology to Croatian people and to the citizens of Croatia for crimes that had been committed by Serbian people in the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. This statement prompted a mixed response in Serbia. Filipovski, speaking for New Serbia, called for a political representative from Croatia to reciprocate the gesture. She was quoted as saying, ""Crimes have not been committed just by Serbs. Crimes must be cleared up so that the real story would be put together in the Balkans.""


A media report in 2007 described Filipovski as one of two New Serbia members best positioned to succeed party leader Velimir IliÄ if he were to resign his position. Filipovski acknowledged IliÄ's importance to the party in this period, saying, ""We could not even imagine our party without Velimir IliÄ and we are proud of that.""


In 2008, Filipovski accused the incoming government of Serbian prime minister Mirko CvetkoviÄ of trying to carry out a ""media purge"" via its appointments to the news agency Tanjug and the journal Politika. She later criticized a police raid on the offices of the tabloid Kurir, claiming that the action was a ""prelude to dictatorship.""


She spoke against the proposed departure of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) from Kosovo and Metohija in 2009, arguing that the organization had an obligation to stay in the disputed region and not to cede its position to the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo. Filipovski was also critical of Islamic Community in Serbia leader Muamer ZukorliÄ during this time, accusing him of favouring the secession of the SandÅ¾ak and of sowing discord between Bosniaks and Serbs.


In February 2010, Filipovski announced that New Serbia would join with the recently formed Serbian Progressive Party in demanding new parliamentary elections. Later in the year, Filipovski and Progressive Party vice-chair Aleksandar VuÄiÄ called on Serbian citizens to join a major anti-government rally planned for June 28.


Filipovski also served as assistant to the president of the VoÅ¾dovac municipality in Belgrade, following the establishment of a municipal governing alliance that included New Serbia. She left the position after being elected to the National Assembly in 2012.


Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. New Serbia joined the Progressive Party's Let's Get Serbia Moving coalition for the 2012 parliamentary election. Filipovski was given the eighteenth position on the alliance's electoral list and was duly elected when the list won seventy-three mandates. After the election, New Serbia joined a coalition government led by the Progressive Party, and Filipovski served as part of the government's parliamentary majority. She received high positions on the Progressive-led lists for the 2014 and 2016 elections and was easily returned when the Progressive coalition won landslide victories on both occasions.


Filipovski resigned from New Serbia in January 2017, saying that she had lost confidence in both IliÄ and the party's direction. This occurred after IliÄ withdrew support from prime minister Aleksandar VuÄiÄ and publicly criticized his administration. A report in Tanjug from this period described Filipovski as having for many years been the only publicly recognizable personality in New Serbia other than IliÄ. Two other New Serbia parliamentarians, Mladen GrujiÄ and Dragan JovanoviÄ, also left the party in this period due to disagreements with IliÄ. All three initially served as independents and continued to support VuÄiÄ's administration. Filipovski joined the Progressive Party on 17 November 2017.

In his later career, he founded Star Waggons, which rented luxury trailers to studios.


Waggoner was born in Kansas City, Kansas, the son of Marie (Isern) and Myron Waggoner, and spent part of his childhood in Excelsior Springs, Missouri.  On an episode of The Carol Burnett Show, Lyle stated he has three sisters and one brother. In 1953, he graduated from Kirkwood High School in Kirkwood, Missouri, and then studied briefly at Washington University in St. Louis.  He then joined the United States Army, serving two years in West Germany as a radio operator.


Following his military discharge, Waggoner studied mechanical engineering in the junior executive program at the General Motors Institute of Technology.  He then sold encyclopedias door to door.  He made his acting debut as a muscle man in a  Kansas City production of Li'l Abner, after which he created a sales promotion organization that enabled him to make enough money to finance a trip to Los Angeles to start an acting career.


By the mid-1960s, Waggoner was appearing regularly in television and films, including an episode of Gunsmoke (âThe Wishboneâ in 1966).  He was a finalist for the title role in the TV series version of Batman, but lost the role to Adam West.


In 1967, he appeared in Catalina Caper (with Tommy Kirk, a former child actor trying to restart his career as a young adult), a film which would eventually be lampooned by Mystery Science Theater 3000. He also had a minor guest-starring role in the season-three episode ""Deadliest of the Species"" of the TV series Lost in Space.


Also in 1967, Waggoner began a seven-year stint on The Carol Burnett Show, a comedy sketch and variety show, on which he appeared as an announcer and performer. In 1973, Waggoner became Playgirl's first male semi-nude centerfold.  Waggoner left The Carol Burnett Show in 1974 in the hopes of advancing his career as a lead actor.  His spot on the show was filled by frequent guest star Tim Conway (and his role as announcer by Ernie Anderson).  He later appeared on some of the show's reunion specials.


In 1976, Waggoner was appointed ""mayor"" of Encino, California, by the local chamber of commerce.  The ""mayor"" is not an actual government official as Encino is not an independent town but rather part of the city of Los Angeles; the post is an honorary ""goodwill ambassador"" position.  In addition to Waggoner, other holders of the title have included Steve Allen, Mike Connors, Fred Travalena, Ronnie Schell, and Cesare Danova.


A year after leaving Carol Burnett, Waggoner landed the role of Steve Trevor for the pilot and first season of the television series Wonder Woman starring Lynda Carter. Initially set during World War II, when the subsequent two seasons advanced the timeline to the 1970s, Waggoner played Steve Trevor, Jr.


Waggoner also appeared in several TV movies and minor motion pictures during the 1970s and 1980s, often cast for ""hunk"" appeal. He made guest appearances on numerous television series including Charlie's Angels, The San Pedro Beach Bums, Happy Days, Mork & Mindy, The Golden Girls, Ellen, and most recently The War at Home. Waggoner also played at least three roles on The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, and Murder, She Wrote throughout their respective runs.


In 1979, while working on Wonder Woman, Waggoner discovered that the motorhome he was using during the production was rented by the studio from a nearby resident. Waggoner soon bought a fleet of motor homes at $50,000 apiece, renting them out to Hollywood productions for $400-$500 per week. Soon after he founded Star Waggons, a company that leased customized location trailers for use by the entertainment industry.  Waggoner retired from full-time acting to run Star Waggons, but made occasional appearances, often parodying his earlier image (The Naked Truth, That '70s Show, and Return to the Batcave).


In 1990, Waggoner co-produced and appeared in a consumer-product show called Consumer America with co-host Shawn Bruner. The series featured novel national products from self-help to home goods and lasted for about two seasons.


In 1993, Waggoner was the host of an infomercial, ""Let's Talk With Lyle Waggoner"", which advertised ""Y-Bron"", supposedly a natural product that would cure male impotence. Scottsdale, Arizona based Twin Star was later fined $1.5 million for unsubstantiated claims about Y-Bron.


Waggoner was married to Sharon Kennedy, an actress, financial consultant, and realtor. They married in 1961 and had two sons, Jason and Beau. He resided near Jackson, Wyoming, where he was a sculptor. His works can be seen at West Lives On Gallery of Fine Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and are usually humorous renditions of lovely ladies, some of which are cast at Eagle Bronze in Lander, Wyoming. He also had homes in  Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico; Oxnard, California, and Westlake Village, California.


Waggoner died in his home in the Los Angeles area at the age of 84 on March 17, 2020, from cancer.",3,16 July 2005, 7 September 2021,348,1,1
6753813,Luther Bradish,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Bradish,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luther_Bradish&action=info,"Luther Bradish (September 15, 1783 in Cummington, Massachusetts â August 30, 1863 in Newport, Rhode Island) was an American lawyer and politician who served two terms as Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1839 to 1842, while his Whig Party colleague, William H. Seward was governor. He was also co-founder of Children's Village.


Luther Bradish was born in 1783 in Cummington, Massachusetts, the son of Col. John Bradish, a Revolutionary War veteran, and Hannah Bradish (nÃ©e Warner). He graduated from Williams College in 1804. He read the law and passed the bar, becoming an attorney and entering practice. Bradish served in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812. In 1814, he married Helen Elizabeth Gibbs (daughter of George Gibbs). She died in 1816 along with their son.


In 1819, Bradish was commissioned by United States Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, under U.S. President James Monroe, to pursue a treaty with the Ottoman Empire on commerce and shipping in the Mediterranean. Up till that point, Philadelphian David Offley was interceding, on behalf of American shippers, with the Empire's regencies along the Barbary Coast, i.e., Algiers, Libya, Tunis, etc., His effectiveness was limited because the U.S had no official relations with the Empire, even after the conclusion of the First and the Second Barbary Wars. The treaty terms demanded by Halet Efendi, the Ottoman foreign minister, were unacceptable to the U.S. Because Halet was thought to have contributed to a Greek insurrection in 1821 by poor policy, displeasing the Sultan, he was banished from the Empire's capital of Constantinople (Istanbul) and executed in 1822.


It was not until May 1830, during President Andrew Jackson's term in office, that a different US negotiating team completed a treaty of commerce and navigation with the Ottoman Empire. It was quickly ratified by Congress.


While living in Morira, in 1826 Bradish was elected from Franklin County to the New York State Assembly, serving from 1828 to 1830, and again from 1836 to 1838.  During his last term in the Assembly, he was elected as Speaker.


In 1838 Bradish ran as a Whig candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1838, when abolitionism was growing as a political force. Its activists posed three questions to all candidates for the top two positions, to determine their positions on the following issues:
1) the right of blacks to a jury trial when seized as fugitive slaves;
2) a law freeing slaves-in-transit the moment they were brought into the state by their masters; and
3) equal suffrage for blacks.


Due to his support for all three, Bradish was endorsed by the abolitionists. He was elected as Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1838, serving two terms from 1839 to 1842 under Governor Seward. As governor, Seward signed legislation in support of issues which he had not committed to during the campaign, enlarging rights and opportunities for African Americans in the state. When Seward declined to run for re-election in 1842, Bradish ran for Governor, but was defeated by Democrat William C. Bouck.


From 1850 until his death in 1863, Bradish was the President of the New-York Historical Society, based in New York City.


In 1855 Williams College conferred on him the degree of LL.D. During President Fillmore's administration, he was appointed as Assistant United States Treasurer at New York.


In 1862, Bradish was elected president of the American Bible Society (ABS). He died in office. He was succeeded in February 1864 by ABS vice-president James Lenox.


Bradish died at the Ocean House Hotel in Newport, Rhode Island. His body was returned to New York, where he was buried at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.",0,29 August 2006, 4 September 2021,107,2,2

22178173,Transit case,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_case,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transit_case&action=info,"A transit case is a hard-sided case intended for protecting and concealing defined contents during transportation. In some forms, the interior is filled with foam which has pockets molded or cut into it that equipment specifically fits into.  Some transit cases are provided with foam inserts that completely fill the interior and the user can pluck out pieces to make the case fit a particular application. Many camera cases are built in this fashion allowing the user to tailor the interior foam to their particular equipment.  The outside of the transit case provides protection against the environment and a first level of protection against mechanical damage such as shock. The interior foam or other structure cushions the equipment against shock and vibration and some protection against rapid temperature changes.


The difference between a transit case and a suit case is a transit case is configured with internal foam or other structure to hold and protect specific items.  A suit case is an empty case in which items can be placed in any order with no predefined locations other than features such as internal pockets. An empty transit case can be used as a suit case.   


Transit cases can be procured in virtually any size to contain something very small to very large which may require several people or a fork lift to move.


Road cases are a subset of transit cases.  Road cases are traditionally manufactured with plywood sides and metal corner braces.  Transit cases are usually molded or formed from plastic, composite materials or aluminum so the top and bottom sections are seamless.


A rack case is a transit case with provision for mounting rackmount equipment such as amplifiers, computers, displays, radios, encryption devices, and so forth.  In many cases, the internal 19-inch rack is mounted to the transit case via shock absorbing mounts giving the rack sway space to attenuate shocks and bumps that might be seen during shipment and handling.


A wide variety of features and options are available for transit cases.  The minimum feature set would include: rugged construction to protect the contents from mechanical abuse, tailored internal cushioning, blocking, and bracing, environmental sealing to protect against moisture, humidity, rain, dust, insects, chemicals, etc., multiple draw-down latches to firmly secure the covers on all sides.


Other available features may include the following: hinged or lift-off lid, two removable end caps, pre-cut foam, custom factory-cut foam, or do-it-yourself foam, rackmount rails for installation of 19-inch rackmount equipment, shock mounts for an internal rackmount frame, Retractable handles which are protected in some regard during shipping, airtight seal when the lid is closed and latched down, atmospheric pressure equalization valve , nitrogen filler valve, humidity indicators, wheels or casters, wheels and an extensible handle similar to a pull-around suitcase, legs to allow the removed lid to be used as a desk, and environmental controls: air conditioners, heaters or fans.


The principle design of a transit case is to assure environmental sealing and protection for the contents in adverse circumstances.  Thus, construction techniques that provide seamless components (body, lid, end caps) are primarily used: rotomolded and thermoformed polyethylene, rotomolded LLDPE thermoplastic, deep drawn aluminum, fiberglass reinforced thermoset composites, FRP composite (fiberglass reinforced polyester), carbon fiber composite, carbon fiber / Kevlar composites, laminated materials (mostly used on road cases)",0,28 March 2009, 30 August 2019,45,0,0

Whilst an Indigenous Australian, a Gundabooka man, he was assumed to be otherwise by others during competition.  


Hobson was born on 5 November 1942 in Bourke, New South Wales to Fanny Williams and Percy Hobson.  Fanny was the daughter of a respected NSW Police Aboriginal tracker Frank Williams. One of ten children, Hobson was named Percy after his father and Francis after his grandfather and uncle who was killed on active service in Malaya around the time of his birth.  His mother Fanny was from Brewarrina.  During his youth Hobson trained using a makeshift high-jump.


In November 1961 Percy Hobson broke the NSW resident high-jump record with a leap of 6'8"". In March 1962 at the Australian Athletics Championships, Hobson won the high jump event with a jump of 6Â ft 7Â in (2.01Â m), defeating Tony Sneazwell on a countback. Eight months later at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Hobson, aged 20 years, won gold in the high jump clearing the bar at 6Â ft 11Â in (2.11Â m), setting a new Commonwealth Games record. In doing so, he became the first Indigenous Australian to win a gold medal for Australia at the Commonwealth Games. Hobson received a hero's welcome when he returned to Bourke with the local brass band played ""Hail, the Conquering Hero"".


A local park in Bourke was later renamed Percy Hobson Park in his honour.


A small standing exhibit on Hobson is at Bourke's The Back 'O Bourke Exhibition Centre. 


On the park's water tower, a mural project was commenced prior to July 2020 to raise funds to paint a mural on the tower, supported by Hobson's sisters Freda Harvey and Heather Mieni.

Dora Creek is named for the creek running through its centre, and was originally known as Doree Doree in the local Aboriginal language, which means ""Creek running into a lake"".


There is an interesting geological phenomena at Dora Creek's connection to the lake. The banks of the creek have formed into two peninsula jutting out into the lake like a point. Thus the aboriginal name is explained, the creek is literally in a lakeâthe points are merely the banks of the creek! The sediment deposited by the creek has not formed a large flood plain or river delta, but has left behind  two banks. This is  where the agitation of the lake by winds  causes enough erosion to wash away the flood plain that would otherwise appear at the delta or near were a creek floods.   However the erosion caused by the lake's waves is not enough to erode away the clay sediments that deposit on the banks of the creek. For that reason, the banks of the creek have grown due to flooding, and appear now as two points, with a creek inside. Similar structures can be seen at creeks nearby too, with good examples at Stoney Creek, Lake Street, Blackalls Park, which is more clearly a type of river delta, where the flat land is created by floods deposition, and at Wyong Creek in a lake a little south, where a similar ""two points with creek inside"" or ""creek in lake"", is in existence, but they are smaller and demonstrating how the points grow.


The Lake Macquarie Council has placed emphasis on the Dora Creek environment, carrying out major foreshore restoration works, and educating the public about the protection of creeks and waterways. It is known for its scenery and proximity to the Watagan Mountains.[citation needed] It is close to the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway and Dora Creek Railway Station.


In the 2016 Census, there were 1,643 people in Dora Creek. 82.1% of people were born in Australia and 92.8% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 31.4%, Anglican 23.9% and Catholic 17.8%.",1,17 September 2005, 9 January 2021,69,0,0

This lactam is a versatile chemical intermediate used in organic and medicinal chemistry.  It is used as a synthetic precursor for three drugs (approved or in clinical trials). It is named after Robert Vince who has used the structural features of this molecule for the preparation of carbocyclic nucleosides. Vince's work with this lactam eventually led to his synthesis of abacavir. Peramivir synthesis is also dependent on Vince lactam starting material.


Vince lactam has been extensively used for the preparation of various carbocyclic nucleosides with medicinal applications in mind, including carbocyclic puromycin (I), carbocyclic Ara-A (II), carbovir (III) and guanine as well as azaguanine carbocyclic derivatives (IV)





Vince lactam is also an intermediate in the synthesis of various nucleoside analogs such as difluoro guanosine derivatives (V), carbocyclic oxanosine and related derivatives (VI), and precursors for azidocarbonucleosides (VII). The lactam has found several applications in targeting an array of different diseased conditions by providing various non-nucleoside therapeutic molecules as well.

Johnson,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_L._Johnson,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_L._Johnson&action=info,"Stephen Lee Johnson (born March 21, 1951) is an American politician who served as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under President George W. Bush during the second term of his administration.  He has received the Presidential Rank Award, the highest award that can be given to a civilian federal employee.


Johnson attended Taylor University, receiving a B.A. in biology followed by a master's degree in pathology from George Washington University. Before working for the U.S. Government, he held a number of positions in laboratory and bio-technology companies. He was also the director of Hazelton Laboratories, now Covance. He has been awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees by Taylor University and Virginia Wesleyan College.


Johnson began working at the EPA in 1979. He had been working at a private lab, Litton Bionetics Inc., in Washington. Johnson said that a mentor suggested he get a job at the EPA, learn about regulations from inside government, and then return to industry. ""Regulations were really frustrating,"" Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2008, recalling his decision to join the EPA. ""I wondered if they really understood what it was like to work in a laboratory.""


Johnson's rise from career scientist to EPA chief began in 2001, when he made the jump from civil service bureaucrat to political appointee. In January 2001, Johnson was the lead staff toxics official at EPA.  His selection as assistant administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances was set in motion by a Kentucky lobbyist, Charles Grizzle, whose clients have included power companies, hospitals, shopping centers, and a formaldehyde industry association. After the 2000 election, Grizzle called then-senior White House aide Karl Rove and suggested that Rove should take a look at Johnson.


When EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman resigned in 2003, Johnson became the acting deputy administrator, the number two position at EPA, and remained in that position when former Utah governor Michael O. Leavitt was named administrator.


On January 26, 2005, when Leavitt became secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Johnson became acting administrator of EPA. On March 4, 2005, President George W. Bush nominated him formally for the permanent position. He became the first career employee to hold the position of Administrator and the first scientist to head the Agency.


During his April 6, 2005 Senate confirmation hearing, EPA was criticized for support of using human subjects in pesticide testing. 
Johnson ""did not have the opportunity to fully address the committee's criticisms before the hearing was recessed.""
In April 2005, a secret hold was placed on his confirmation vote while he evaluated the Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study, which advocated recording the effects of pesticides on children from infancy to age 3.  In a letter that reached Senator Barbara Boxer several hours after she raised her concerns, Johnson said, ""No additional work will be conducted on this study subject to the outcome of external scientific and ethical review."" On April 8, Johnson canceled the study. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 29.  On February 6, 2006, he issued a final regulation ""prohibiting new research involving intentional exposure of pregnant women or children intended for submission to the EPA under the pesticide laws"" and other protections.


Johnson tried to block the efforts of 17 states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy.  He defended his position by arguing that ""The Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution, not a confusing patchwork of state rules. I believe this is a better approach than if individual states were to act alone.""  The state rules he was blocking were more stringent than the Bush administration's proposed national solution. Johnson came under investigation for allowing the White House to improperly interfere with the decision to grant California a waiver to limit greenhouse gases. On May 20, 2008, Johnson was questioned for three hours by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  On July 29, 2008, four Senators called for Johnson's resignation, alleging he made false statements to Congress.


On December 9, 2008, the Office of Inspector General, US EPA concluded that ""EPA's California waiver decision on greenhouse gas automobile emissions met statutory procedural requirements.""

On May 19, 2009, President Obama also concluded: ""a clear and uniform national policy is also good news for the auto industry which will no longer be subjected to a costly patchwork of differing rules and regulations.""



Johnson's stance on this and other issues was criticized in an editorial by the scientific journal Nature, which claimed he acted with ""reckless disregard for law, science or the agency's own rules â or, it seems, the anguished protests of his own subordinates.""
In spite of this external criticism and over the objections of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, Energy, Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Council of Economic Advisors, and Small Business Administration, Johnson issued the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, ""Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air Act.""

On February 29, 2008, four labor unions representing 10.000 of the EPA's 17.000 employees (ca. 60%) published an open letter to Johnson, complaining that he had ignored the EPA's official Principles of Scientific Integrity in advancing Bush Administration positions on water fluoridation, pesticide regulation, mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas control.


As Administrator, he managed more than 17,000 Agency employees nationwide and oversaw an annual budget of $7.7 billion.  His tenure expired on January 20, 2009.


On June 29, 2010, clean technology company FlexEnergy announced that Johnson had joined its board of directors.
According to Johnson, the company's technology can minimize air pollutants in congested cities and industrial sites, as well as provide energy in remote areas around the world.


On November 11, 2010, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company announced that Johnson had been named to its board of directors.


Johnson also sits on the board of trustees at his alma mater, Taylor University.",1,4 March 2005, 26 September 2021,239,1,1

With its comic references to The Exorcist and Audition, Buppah Rahtree gained a cult following through screenings at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival and the Fantasia Festival. Its sequels are Buppah Rahtree Phase 2: Rahtree Returns (2005), Rahtree Reborn (Buppha Rahtree 3.1) (2009) and Rahtree Revenge (Buppha Rahtree 3.2) (2009).


Buppah Rahtree is a loner female student at a Bangkok university who becomes the object of a wager by a group of male students to see if she can be bedded. Ake, the son of a wealthy family, takes the bet and courts young Buppah. She resists him at first, but one day sees him feeding pigeons in a park and talks to him. After she expresses her desire to fly away, they go on a ride in Ake's convertible. They continue to have a relationship, which culminates in a three-day weekend at Bang Saen, during which Ake has sex with her; he stays in bed with her the whole time. Ake shows videotapes of their sex to his friends, and for his efforts wins a bottle of Johnnie Walker, which he reflects to himself seems like a trivial prize for messing up another person's life. Ake breaks off all contact with Buppah.


After her stepfather gives her a car ride, he takes her to a short-time hotel and sexually assaults her. She stabs him with a fountain pen he gaver her as a present and runs home to her apartment. Depressed, she contemplates suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from Ake, who wants to meet her. Ake tells her about the wager and apologizes. Though he plans to leave Thailand to study in England, he hopes to maintain their friendship. Buppah informs Ake she is two months' pregnant. Ake's mother tells him to convince Buppah to have an abortion. After the operation, he drives her back to her apartment, and it is obvious she is in pain. Ake leaves to get rice congee but does not return.


After unsuccessfully attempting to collect rent, Buppah's landlady breaks into the apartment, where she discovers Buppah's corpse; Buppah bled to death due to complications from the abortion. When the authorities arrive, Buppah revives, and her vengeful spirit refuses to be dislodged. Mrs. See calls upon Maew, a false shaman who hustles locals, to exorcise the spirit. When he fails, Maew convinces his teacher, Master Tong, to try. For his effort, Master Tong is left with a knife in his back. A pair of Roman Catholic priests perform an exorcism, only to end up curse at and vomited upon by the ghost. As Buppah haunts the building, residents leave in droves, ruining Mrs. See's finances.


In England, Ake grows homesick and has turned to drug use. He returns to Thailand and offers to bring Buppah rice congee. Ake catches the eye of Muay, a young woman at the congee stand. Muay seduces Ake and has him take her to an old cinema, where they have sex. When Ake returns to Buppah's apartment, he has forgotten the congee. Buppah knows that Ake has cheated on her, and for his transgression, she amputates his legs. Muay comes to the apartment to find Ake. Buppah takes possession of Muay's body and compels Muay to cut her own legs off.


Mrs. See recruits a genuine shaman from Cambodia. The shaman and his men come to the apartment just as Muay is being possessed. They put a spirit cloth over Ake and on Buppah's corpse. Through a prayer, the shaman puts Buppah's spirit back into the corpse. They plan to take Buppah to a temple to be cremated, but on the way, the spirit cloth blows off the body, which is in the back of a pickup truck. Buppah takes control of the vehicle and causes it to crash into another truck.


Muay, saddened by the turn of events, makes contact with Ake's father, who is angered and puzzled by the call. As it turns out, Ake has been dead for more than a month. Muay had sexual relations with Ake's ghost.


Buppah returns to her apartment, where she will likely stay for eternity. Ake's ghost, now legless, sits outside in the hallway and apologizes to Buppah for the rest of his ghost eternity.


A soundtrack album, Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: Buppah Rahtree, was released to accompany the film. It features a mix of Thai hip hop and pop music. Most of the tracks feature members of Joey Boy's rap collective Gancore Club, the heavyset duo BZ and Fukking Hero, who were also featured in the film as residents of a neighboring apartment to Rahtree's.",5,2 November 2006, 18 May 2021,65,0,0
20954179,HM Prison Preston,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Preston,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HM_Prison_Preston&action=info,"HM Prison Preston is a Category B men's prison, located in the City Centre area of Preston in Lancashire, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.


There has been a prison on the current site of HMP Preston since 1790, however it was completely rebuilt as a Victorian radial design prison between 1840 and 1895. Closed from 1931 to 1939, the prison was used by the military from 1939 to 1948. That year, the prison was converted back to civilian use. It was re-roled as a Category B prison for local adult males in 1990.


In October 1999, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that progress at the prison was being impeded by ""obstructive and uncooperative staff"" who ""used a heavy-handed approach with inmates and relied on strength of numbers rather than personal relationships to keep order.""


In July 2001, it was revealed that Preston was the most overcrowded prison in England and Wales. Statistics showed that Preston had a 78% rate of overcrowding. Three years later, a report from the Prison Reform Trust again highlighted Preston as being the most overcrowded prison, with 90% of inmates sharing single cells.


Preston is a Category B prison holding local adult males, remanded or sentenced from Crown Courts and Magistrates Courts serving Lancashire and Cumbria.

It has between four and six leaves and up to seven large, bright yellow flowers with reddish-brown markings.


Diuris carinata is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and six erect leaves 100â200Â mm (4â8Â in) long and 3â6Â mm (0.1â0.2Â in) wide. Between two and seven bright yellow flowers with reddish brown markings, about 30Â mm (1Â in) long and 20â30Â mm (0.8â1Â in) wide are borne on a flowering stem 500â800Â mm (20â30Â in) tall. The dorsal sepal is angled upwards, 14â18Â mm (0.6â0.7Â in) long, 9â12Â mm (0.4â0.5Â in) wide and tapered. The lateral sepals turn downwards below the horizontal, 18â22Â mm (0.7â0.9Â in) long, 3.5â5Â mm (0.1â0.2Â in) wide. The petals are erect or curve backwards, 12â16Â mm (0.5â0.6Â in) long and 10â12Â mm (0.4â0.5Â in) wide on a blackish stalk 5â7Â mm (0.2â0.3Â in) long. The labellum is 15â18Â mm (0.6â0.7Â in) long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped to wedge-shaped, 12â16Â mm (0.5â0.6Â in) long and 11â14Â mm (0.4â0.6Â in) wide. The side lobes are 7â10Â mm (0.3â0.4Â in) long and 4â6Â mm (0.16â0.24Â in) wide and spread apart from each other. There are two parallel callus ridges 7â9Â mm (0.3â0.4Â in) long at the base of the mid-line of the labellum and outlined with reddish brown. Flowering occurs in October and November.


Diuris carinata was first formally described by John Lindley in his 1840 book The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants from a specimen collected by James Drummond near the Swan River. Its specific epithet (carinata) is a Latin word meaning ""keeled"", referring to the keel-like structure of parts of the flower.

3001724,Rehearsing My Choir,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehearsing_My_Choir,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rehearsing_My_Choir&action=info,"Rehearsing My Choir is the fourth full-length album by The Fiery Furnaces and was released in 2005. It is a concept album featuring Olga Sarantos, grandmother of the band's Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger, narrating stories relating to her life. Though the instrumentation is as complex as on the band's previous releases, the vocals mostly take the form of spoken word. At points Eleanor Friedberger speaks or sings words corresponding to the character of a younger Olga Sarantos, the two engaging in dialogue. This aspect has made many draw relations between the album and a radio play.  Olga Sarantos died on December 31, 2007. 


Like Blueberry Boat, the album shifts around in a non time-linear way. It also includes a few sections separate from the main story. In the album's press release, Matthew Friedberger, the songwriter and lyricist, gives a summary and explanation:


Dear Listener, Tracks 3 and 4 take place in the 40s; tracks 5 and 6 in the 20s and 30s; track 7 in the later 50s; track 8 starts in the very early 40s; track 9 goes back and forth; track 10 takes place in the early 60s; the final track takes place in the early 90s. Track 2 takes place a few years ago; track 1 took place when it was recorded. The action depicted in ""The Wayward Granddaughter"" and ""Slavin' Away"" does not include the character Olga Sarantos plays on the rest of the record. ""Slavin' Away"" imagines that characterâthe main characterâfantasizing, a bit remotely, about the hard lot of other women. Now, I wouldn't guess that the Main Character actually thought the woman concerned was riding around in a Norton side-car and operating her own cottage industry trinket assembly/sweatshop: but it might have pleased her to picture it so. ""The Wayward Granddaughter"" is about a different Greek-American grandmother and her popular granddaughter (""Connie""). They're from Chicago's south suburbs and don't figure in the rest of the record; I wanted to have another (slightly younger) grandmother and family in there for perspective or comparison's sake, so to speak. Thank you for your time, Matthew Friedberger


Like much of the band's output, the album received both enthusiastically positive and negative reviews from music critics. JSpicer at Tiny Mix Tapes called it a ""Great American Novel via guitars, drums, bells, and whistles"" and admired its envelope-pushing sound and unique storytelling. Justin Cober-Lake at PopMatters found the storytelling ""neither nuanced nor complex"" and wrote that the music ""lacks the focus, coherence, and development to be rewarding beyond a novelty listen.""",1,26 October 2005, 19 August 2021,77,0,0
3718413,Carhaix-Plouguer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carhaix-Plouguer,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carhaix-Plouguer&action=info,"Carhaix-Plouguer (French pronunciation:Â â[kaÊÉ pluÉ¡ÉÊ], [kaÊe]; Breton: Karaez-PlougÃªr, [kaËrÉËs ËpluËÉ¡ÉËr]), commonly known as Carhaix (Karaez), is a commune in the French department of FinistÃ¨re, region of Brittany, France.


Carhaix is located in the Poher, an important territory of Brittany, sandwiched between the ArrÃ©e Mountains to the north and the Black Mountains to the south. The agglomeration developed mainly on a plateau located at 140 meters above sea level, gently sloping towards the west, the highest elevations being eastwards beyond the agglomeration towards 155â169 meters above sea level. This plateau is limited to the north by the valley of the HyÃ¨res (60 meters elevation that imposed the construction of an aqueduct in Roman times to cross it), which flows to 80 meters above sea level, and south by the stream of the Madeleine whose route was taken again by the channel of Nantes in Brest. The HyÃ¨res sometimes causes serious floods: in March 1903, the Sainte-Catherine chapel located in PlounevÃ©zel but at the limit of Carhaix, had water up to the roof and in 1910 to the stained glass windows.


Geologically, Carhaix is located in the center of the ChÃ¢teaulin basin, which consists mainly of slate and sandstone schists and forms a topographic depression between the ArrÃ©e Mountains and the Black Mountains.


Become common to the French Revolution, Carhaix and Plouguer merged in 1956 and took the name of Carhaix-Plouguer. As early as 1862, the municipal council of Carhaix had expressed a wish in this direction.

Le Petit Carhaix: the 18th century bridge on the HyÃ¨res (seen from upstream).


The Meur mill on the HyÃ¨res, old dyke and sluice.


The name in Breton of the commune is Karaez-PlougÃªr.


In a charter signed by the Count of Cornouaille, Hoel, to ""donate a villa near Caer Ahes, in which is the church of sanctus Kigavus (saint Quijeau), we find the oldest form of name of Carhaix, close and contemporary to those mentioned in medieval novels. The charter is necessarily prior to the death of Hoel (1084). Saint-Quijeau is an ancient trÃ¨ve attached to that of Plouguer in the thirteenth century.


The Breton name is Karaez (spelled Carahes in the eleventh century in a charter of Count Hoel, based on the prefix ""Kaer"" which means ""fortified place""). Carhaix is certainly the city behind the Carahes of medieval texts.


At the time of the Tour d'Auvergne and the nineteenth century, it was believed in Kaer AhÃ¨s, the name, AhÃ¨s, of the legendary daughter of Gradlon that would have led Ys in his loss.


The main roads leading to Carhaix were therefore often called ""paths of OhÃ¨s"" or ""roads d'AhÃ¨s"" (Bernard Tanguy). OhÃ¨s as AhÃ¨s are close to the name HoÃ«l. The identification of the place Corophesium, mentioned only in the Annals of Lausanne, is debated (Carhaix or Coray?) For a place of war led by Louis the Pious against the Breton king Morman. It may be that Corophesium represents neither one nor the other, but corresponds, as LÃ©on Fleuriot indicates in his book The Origins of Brittany (1987), to an error of the scribe.


Bernard Tanguy brings Karaes closer to Carofes, attested in Low-Latin for the name of the city of Diablintes and for Charroux (Vienna). It would then be an old * Carofum / * Carofensis (evolution of quadruvium in carruvium), registering Carhaix in its function of road junction. For him, the Corophesium where Louis the Pious surrenders in 818 is a cacography of Carophesium. Moreover, could the association of Charlemagne with Carhaix in the novel of Aiquin be based on the expedition of his son, Louis the Pious, about which is named Corophesium?


The permanence of the Carhaix crossroads function, together with its decline in the Lower Empire, may explain that, although the city was the capital of Osism, they did not leave their name as it was the case. more often in Gaul.


The Vieilles Charrues Festival (Literally: Old Ploughs Festival) is held every year in mid-July.
This festival is one of the largest music events in Europe, attracting more than 200,000 people every year. It is held in the fields once held by the famille de Saisy de Kerampuil and the festival venue is next to the Chateau Kerampuil.


In continental histories Carhaix is thought to be Carohaise of King Leodegrance and the Roman city of Vorgium. It is at Carohaise that the legendary King Arthur defends Leodegrance by defeating Rience, and meets Guinevere, Leodegrance's daughter. Modern archaeological digs have uncovered evidence of the ancient Roman city including its aqueduct system.


Inhabitants of Carhaix-Plouguer are called Carhaisiens.


There are about 2680 students in Carhaix, of which 234 attended a Diwan school as of school year 2003-04. Carhaix has one Diwan preschool, one primary school and a Diwan lycÃ©e (which is also the only lycÃ©e of Diwan). The lycÃ©e was from 1994 to 1999 first located in Brest. In 1999 it moved to Carhaix.


The municipality launched a linguistic plan through Ya d'ar brezhoneg on April 9, 2004.


In 2008, 21.49% of primary-school children attended bilingual schools.

Often, the result of this kick is of little consequence, but if the player is within range of goal, any score will count towards the final result.


The right to take a set shot after the final bell was enshrined in the Laws of the Game prior to the 1889 season; prior to this, the ball was declared dead and any right to a set shot lost as soon as the bell sounded.


Below is a list of occasions where game results have been decided by set shots taken after the final siren, a play similar to the buzzer-beater in basketball. These are highly memorable and often go down in football folklore.

23915329,Parias,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parias,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parias&action=info,"In medieval Spain, parias (from medieval Latin pariÄre, ""to make equal [an account]"", i.e. pay) were a form of tribute paid by the taifas of al-Andalus to the Christian kingdoms of the north. Parias dominated relations between the Islamic and the Christian states in the years following the disintegration of the Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba (1031) until the reunification of Islamic Spain under the Almoravid dynasty (beginning in 1086). The parias were a form of protection money established by treaty. The payee owed the tributary military protection against foes both Islamic and Christian. Usually the original exaction was forced, either by a large razzia or the threat of one, or as the cost of supporting one Islamic party against another. (The word ""taifa"" means ""party [kingdom]"" and refers to the prevalence of factionalism in Islamic Spain during the taifas era.)


The earliest evidence of parias pertains to eastern Spain, to the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona, which exacted a very early oneâcalled the vetus paria or ""old paria""âfrom the taifa of Zaragoza. While parias may have been paid by the local Muslim leaders just west of the Llobregat after Raymond Borrel's razzia on CÃ³rdoba in 1010, the earliest paria that can be dated was collected by Raymond Berengar I of Barcelona from Lleida and Zaragoza after his attack on those territories in 1045. In the 1060s he was still demanding parias from Lleida and Zaragoza, as well as the taifa of Tortosa. The Aragonese king Sancho RamÃ­rez also took parias from the king of Zaragoza's underlings at Huesca and Tudela.


In western Spain the first ruler to exact such tribute was Ferdinand I of LeÃ³n and Castile. From at least 1060, perhaps as early as 1055, Ferdinand had been exacting parias from the taifas of Seville, Toledo, and Zaragoza, and possibly also Badajoz and Valencia. In accordance with his testament, Ferdinand's parias were divided amongst his heirs along with his kingdom in December 1065: the eldest son, Sancho II, received Castile with the vetus paria; the second son, Alfonso VI, received LeÃ³n with the parias of Toledo; and the third son, GarcÃ­a II, received Galicia with the parias of Badajoz and Seville. Eventually all the tribute found its way into the hands of Alfonso VI, who also exacted parias from Granada. Valencia fell into the hands of Rodrigo DÃ­az de Vivar (1094), and upon recovery by the Muslims it was forced to briefly pay parias to Barcelona, payments which were later re-established by Raymond Berengar IV. These parias were still being collected in the reign of James I the Conqueror (1213â76), who put an end to them by conquering Valencia.


Much of the wealth acquired through parias was distributed to cathedrals and monasteries, while some found its way back to the aristocracy. Sometime between 1053 and 1065 Ferdinand of LeÃ³n pledged an annual census of 1,000 aurei for the Abbey of Cluny, a donation re-established by Alfonso VI in 1077 and then increased to 2,000 aurei in 1090 by this same monarch. This, known as the ""Alfonsine census"", was ""the biggest donation that Cluny ever received from king or layman, and it was never to be surpassed"". The large payments to Cluny, which financed Hugh the Great's construction of the massive third abbey church, undoubtedly helped publish the wealth of Spain throughout Europe. Unfortunately for Cluny, changing conditions in Spain caused the payments to cease in 1111, and this brought on a financial crisis during the abbacies of Pons of Melgueil (1109â22) and Peter the Venerable (1122â56). By 1100 the parias had decreased to a mere ""trickle"". Only in 1246, when the Kingdom of Granada, the last remaining Islamic state in Spain, agreed to pay half its annual revenue in parias to Castile, did tribute again constitute a major portion of Christian Spain's wealth. Though the burden of these last parias was sometimes reduced to a quarter or a fifth of state revenue, the Grenadine kings were forced to tax their subjects far beyond what was permissible under Islamic law.


Parias were generally paid in gold coin (aurei, ""golden ones"", or numos de auro, ""coins of gold"", in Latin), usually Islamic dinars or mithqals, accompanied by gifts of carpets, silks, ivories, plate, and other luxuries not produced widely in Christian Europe. They were extremely large sums for the times, though it is impossible to determine their precise value in modern terms. The vetus paria in about 1060, when it was being paid to Ferdinand of LeÃ³n, was worth around 10,000 aurei per annum. This was raised to 12,000 numos de auro per annum when Sancho IV of Navarre acquired it. In 1075 Alfonso VI negotiated 30,000 mithqals from Granada, including two years' worth of arrears, putting the annual parias at around 10,000 mithqals, comparable to the vetus paria. The largest parias on record were those forced on the eastern taifas by Alfonso's vassal Rodrigo DÃ­az de Vivar in 1089â91, during which period he took in 146,000 dinars. By comparison, a typical nobleman's ransom cost 500â1,000 aurei in contemporary Spain and in CÃ³rdoba 400 horses or seventy human slaves were worth about 10,000 mithqals in the 1060s. ""From being among the poorest rulers in Europe,"" historian Richard Fletcher notes, ""[the Christian kings of Spain] quickly became among the richest,"" and ""the kingdom of LeÃ³n-Castile, in particular, acquired a reputation for inexhaustible wealth during the second half of the eleventh century,"" due in large part to the receipt of parias.",0,9 August 2009, 25 May 2021,39,0,0

It was produced and directed by George Mendeluk and co-produced by John Ryan from a screenplay by Richard Murphy and Charles Templeton, based on Templeton's 1977 novel of the same name. The original music is by Nash the Slash and Paul Zaza and the cinematography by Mike Molloy. The film was made by Presidential Films and Sefel Films and distributed by Crown International Pictures.


During a state visit to Canada, President Adam Scott (Hal Holbrook) is warned by Secret Service agent Jerry O'Connor (William Shatner) about a potential threat to his life. Scott ignores O'Connor's warning and is consequently abducted (while walking through Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto) by South American terrorist Roberto Assanti (Miguel Fernandes) and his female accomplice. They demand $100 million in diamonds along with two airplanes as ransom for the president's safe return.


While Scott is being held captive in an armored truck booby-trap with high explosives timed to detonate at midnight, O'Connor must find a way into the truck to rescue him before that happens, while also contending with a turf war between various U.S. federal law enforcement agencies and the political ambitions of the U.S. vice president, Ethan Richards (Van Johnson).


Agent O'Connor eventually gets one of Assanti's terrorist group members to turn on Assanti, which caused Assanti's sister to die. O'Connor learns Assanti's plan for the president and develops a plan to save the President by going through the engine and firewall with a cutting torch.


The movie is based on Charles Templeton's 1977 bestseller novel of the same name.  The primary difference between the two is the story's location. The book sets the kidnapping in New York City's Herald Square and the subsequent siege in nearby Times Square. In the movie, the kidnapping occurs in Templeton's home city, Toronto, with the mob, chase, and explosion scenes commencing in Nathan Phillips Square.


Although the novel and the film have their differences, senior feature writer at The Globe and Mail Stephen Godfrey found ""the film is as easy to 'read' as the book apparently was. The inevitable cross-cutting, from fanatical terrorists to the presidential cavalcade, and later, from a nearly unflappable security man (William Shatner) in Toronto, is well handed.""


The film received lukewarm ratings overall. It received a lot of talk from the New York Post and the Newark Star Ledger as well as outstanding reviews from Bergen Records and other newspaper organizations.


Unlike Bergen Records and other newspapers, Janet Maslin, from The New York Times, disagreed with the reviews because she thought the plot was not fresh enough to be frightening and the characters were not brave enough to do anything new.


Chris Lowry, a writer for Film Reviews, found George Mendeluk's directing uninspiring and Richard Murphy's screenplay mediocre for an action movie. Lowry stated, ""the film disorients and disturbs the audience at the outset"" since the subject of kidnapping a president isn't a funny concept in general. He expected the editing to be better as well since the readers of the novel were aware that the setting is different in the film compared to the novel.


The film received two nominations in the 1981 Genie Awards.

Two members of this genus, Haliclystus kerguelensis and Haliclystus antarcticus, are found in the Southern hemisphere only.  The remaining 9 members are found in the Northern hemisphere only.


Species in this genus have four longitudinal planes of symmetry.  They have eight arms which are tipped with clusters of secondary tentacles.  The number of these secondary tentacles is reported to vary across the different species.  Species in this genus also have eight large pads known as anchors located between the arms.  These vary in size and shape and currently play in important role in differentiating one species from another.  Some, but not all, species in this genus have prominent white nematocyst clusters.

Community archives are created in response to needs defined by the members of a community, who may also exert control over how materials are used. The project is a collaborative effort between Queens College, City University of New York and Queens Public Library that was initially funded in 2010 through a grant from the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO). Materials in the archive are made accessible to the public through a website which contains oral history interviews and photographs documenting the lives of Queens residents. The stories and images are presented alongside digitized historical photographs, maps, news clippings and other archival records. The goal of the project is to allow visitors to the site to view otherwise scattered archival materials and personal stories in a searchable database of collective memory representing the borough of Queens.


The archive began in June 2010 as an independent study for project director and archivist Natalie Milbrodt, then a Special Collections and Archives Fellow in the Queens College Libraries and a master's degree candidate in the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies. Focusing on the neighborhood of Flushing, Milbrodt conducted oral history interviews with 20 residents in the Waldheim neighborhood, a small area less than a mile from downtown Flushing. A grant from the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) enabled her to establish collaboration with Queens Public Library to combine archival materials from their holdings relevant to Queens history with those of Queens College.  The website for the Queens Memory Project was later developed by software firm Whirl-i-Gig and officially launched to the public on October 27, 2011.  The site combines digital audio of the project interviews with images and other digital content from the collections.  Development of the Queens Memory Project since 2011 has focused on expanded documentation across the borough of Queens, collaboration with educators, scholars, artists, and community groups.  Future development will incorporate Web 2.0 technology to allow direct user contributions.


The Queens Memory team offers weekly trainings for new volunteers and those interested in conducting oral history interviews. These trainings are free and intended to empower Queens residents to create high quality additions to local history collections at Queens Public Library.


The collection contains over 500 individual oral history interviews from residents of Queens.  Nearly all of these interviews were conducted by volunteers who received training from Queens Memory Project staff working at Queens Public Library or Queens College CUNY. Many of these interviews are available online with transcriptions.


Wild Sound recordings are audio recordings that document events and public places in Queens. The recordings are in digital WAV format.

85055,Avernus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avernus,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avernus&action=info,"Avernus was an ancient name for a volcanic crater near Cumae (Cuma), Italy, in the region of Campania west of Naples. Part of the Phlegraean Fields of volcanoes, Avernus is approximately 3.2 kilometres (2.0Â mi) in circumference. Within the crater is Lake Avernus (Lago d'Averno).


Avernus was believed to be the entrance to the underworld, and is portrayed as such in the Aeneid of Virgil. According to tradition, all birds flying over the lake were destined to fall dead, hence the lakeâs name was transferred to Greek as á¼Î¿ÏÎ½Î¿Ï (Î»Î¯Î¼Î½Î·) Ãornos (lÃ­mnÄ)â or ""Birdless (lake)"". This was likely due to the toxic fumes that mouths of the crater gave off into the atmosphere. In later times, the word was simply an alternate name for the underworld.


On the shores of the lake is the grotto of the Cumaean Sibyl and the entrance to a long tunnel (Grotta di Cocceio, c. 800 metres (2,600Â ft)) leading toward Cumae, where her sanctuary was located.  There are also the remains of temples to Apollo and Jupiter.
During the civil war between Octavian and Antony, Agrippa tried to turn the lake into a military port, the Portus Julius.  A waterway was dug from Lake Lucrino to Avernus to this end.  The port's remains may still be seen under the lake's surface.


The term avernus (plural averni) was also used by ancient naturalists for certain lakes, grottos, and other places which infect the air with poisonous steams or vapours. The Cave of Dogs in Italy was a famous example. The most celebrated of these, however, is Lake Avernus.


They were also called mephites. Mephitis was the Roman goddess of noxious vapors, who protects against malaria. The adjective ""mephitic"" means ""foul-smelling"" or ""malodorous"".

""Simple,"" said the boy: ""First I shoot the arrow, then I draw the target.""


Kranz was born at Zietil (Yiddish ××©×¢×× Zhetl)(now Dzyatlava), (then Lithuania now Belarus) in about 1740 and died at ZamoÅÄ on 18 December 1804. At the age of eighteen he went to MiÄdzyrzec Podlaski (Meseritz), where he occupied the position of preacher. He stayed there for two years, and then became preacher successively at Zolkiev, Dubno, WÅodawa (Lublin region), Kalisch, and ZamoÅÄ. He remained at Dubno eighteen years and is best known for being the Rabbi here. He left Dubno for Vilnius at the request of the famous Elijah Wilna, who, having recently recovered from a sickness and being unable to study, sought diversion in his conversation.


Kranz was considered to be unrivalled preacher. Possessed of great eloquence, he illustrated both his sermons and his homiletic commentaries with parables taken from human life. By such parables he explained the most difficult passages of the Tanakh, and cleared up many perplexing questions in Halakha. He was also an eminent rabbinical scholar, and on many occasions was consulted as an authority.


Confronted with imposters there were several tests that Kranz would go through to prove he was the true Maggid, opening the Tanakh at random, and inventing parables on the spot.


All of Kranz's works were published after his death by Abraham BÃ¤r Flahm with the permission of Kranz's son Yitzhak Kranz who found the writings of the Maggid in Mezritch where he had preached.


As the author himself had given no name to it, Abraham BÃ¤r Flahm, its editor, at first intended to call it ""Chobot ha-Lebabot he-Chadash"" (The New Duties of the Heart, a reference to an 11th Century famous book); but out of respect for the author, Bachya, he changed his mind. The editor also revised the work, and added to it a preface containing a sketch of Kranz's life, and glosses of his own under the title ""Shiyyure ha-Middot"". Moses Nussbaum of PrzemyÅl extracted from the author's ""Ohel Ya'aqob"" all the parables, and published them in one book entitled ""Mishle Ya'aqob"" (Cracow, 1886). Following an open letter by Abraham Flahm printed in the popular Hagaddah that year, he agreed to print Flahm's preface in the succeeding reprints. The agreement is kept to this day. Several parables never published till modern times, but passed on orally in the family, have been written down by Moshe Kranc, a descendant of the Dubner Maggid, in a book about business and Jewish tales: ""The Hasidic Masters' Guide to Management"".",9,8 October 2005, 9 March 2021,99,0,0

In the 2006 census, 4,047 MÄori claimed affiliation to NgÄ Rauru, representing 12 hapu.


The early history of NgÄ Rauru kitahÄ« starts before the coming of the Te KÄhui Rere, a MÄori tribe that is situated in the South Taranaki area. The iwi takes its name from Rauru KÄ«tahi, a MÄori warrior who, after travelling extensively throughout New Zealand, settled in the south Taranaki region. Rauru KÄ«tahi was the first son of Ruarangi and Rongoueroa (see History of Te Äti Awa), and a descendant of Toi-te-huatahi. Awanuiarangi, the founding ancestor of Te Äti Awa, was Rauru's half-brother.


In the early 19th century, northern iwi including NgÄ Puhi and NgÄti Toa fought other MÄori iwi in campaigns throughout the North Island, armed with European muskets. NgÄ Rauru came under attack from NgÄti Toa in 1822, and from NgÄti Tuwharetoa in the 1840s.


Initial trade relations with Europeans were profitable. However, in the 1850s divisions emerged within tribes across Taranaki over land sales to the government. This eventually led to the New Zealand Wars, starting in Taranaki. As a result, 607 square kilometres was confiscated from NgÄ Rauru by Crown troops. In 1868, NgÄ Rauru supported the NgÄti Ruanui leader TÄ«tokowaru against Crown troops. In response, Crown troops destroyed and confiscated more NgÄ Rauru land, devastating the economy of the iwi. Subsequent loss of control of NgÄ Rauru land occurred through improper land title acquisitions by the New Zealand Government.


Some redress was attempted by the New Zealand Government. Some land was returned to MÄori control, but under perpetual lease by the Public Trustee, and ignoring traditional collective MÄori title. The Sim Commission of 1926-1927 attempted to compensate Taranaki iwi including NgÄ Rauru, but this was seen by many iwi as insufficient, conducted with little or no consultation with Taranaki iwi.


In 1991, NgÄ Rauru submitted its claims to the Waitangi Tribunal. In 1996, the tribunal released The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi, which examined past government attempts at redress. In 2000, NgÄ Rauru entered into negotiations with the New Zealand Government towards a Deed of Settlement. The final settlement was ratified and signed on 27 November 2003. The settlement included:


The NgÄ Rauru Iwi Authority manages the affairs of the iwi and represents it in negotiations with the New Zealand Government. With the Deed of Settlement now concluded, NgÄ Rauru are moving ahead with economic development and plans to revitalise MÄori language use. In particular, the Matauranga Unit of the NgÄ Rauru Iwi Authority was established to compile, collect and preserve information pertaining to whakapapa and the Deed of Settlement, as part of a larger effort to revitalise NgÄ Rauru culture, history and identity.

Â Ottoman Empire


The Revolt of Ahmet Anzavur (Turkish: Ahmet Anzavur AyaklanmasÄ±) was a series of revolts led by the Ottoman gendarme officer Ahmet Anzavur against the Turkish national movement during the Turkish War of Independence. The revolt was coordinated by the monarchist Ottoman government against the republican Turkish nationalist forces. The forces under Anzavur's command were made up of various ethnic groups with the bulk of the forces (including Anzavur) belonging to the Circassian ethnicity. The ""revolt"" occurred October 1, 1919 to November 25, 1920 and occurred in the regions of Biga, BandÄ±rma, Karacabey, and KirmastÄ±. Despite some difficulty, the revolts were decisively put down by the Ãerkes Ethem forces, another Circassian force.


The Revolt of Ahmet Anzavur was a series of revolts from October 1919 to November 1920. These revolts were by those loyal to the monarchy of the Ottoman Empire and opposed the nationalist revolutionary government. Each of these revolts were put down by nationalist commanders soon after they broke out.


The first uprising of Ahmet Anzavur occurred in Manyas in October 1919. Anzavur's declaration to the people of Manyas was that he intended to capture or kill Hacim Muhittin ÃarÄ±klÄ±, the Nationalist commander in the region of BalÄ±kesir. The forces he raised would be used to defend the power of the sultanate, located in Istanbul, from the growing threat of Nationalist forces, based in Ankara. Anzavur sent two telegrams the following day, one to the sultan and the other to Karesi Mustarrif Ali Riza, stating, ""It is the duty of all true Muslims to defeat the Nationalists"". The threat was well understood by the Nationalists in the country, who immediately began to make preparations to counter Ahmet Anzavur's movements.
Following up on his threats, Anzavur took a cohort of his followers to carry out attacks on the provisional Turkish government offices and troops, all the while bringing in more men into his ranks during November 1919. After avoiding talks with Nationalists about cessation of hostilities, Anzavur and his men were labeled common criminals and tools of the British and the palace.


The first actual battle of the rebellion occurred on November 15 north of BalÄ±kesir. Anzavur's forces took heavy losses and were forced to retreat north through Susurluk, whilst being pursued by KÃ¶prÃ¼lÃ¼lÃ¼ Hamdi. By the twentieth, fighting had broken out around GÃ¶nen, Manyas, Karacabey, Biga, and Susurluk. By the end of November, Anzavur's forces had to flee from Ãerkes Ethem's forces. As winter approached, Anzavur disbanded his forces who melted into surrounding areas.


Ahmet Fevzi PaÅa, also a Circassian, was sent to prevent Anzavur's influence in the region from growing. He attempted to recruit local Circassians for the nationalist Kuva-yi Milliye, but scholars believe that he was unsuccessful.


After the harsh winter of 1920, Anzavur began recruiting for another campaign.  This army would be known as The Army of Muhammad.  Hostilities began again on February 16, 1920. As the vanguard of Anzavur's motley army entered Biga, shots rang out. Hamidi fled to a nearby weapons depot as the town fell to Anzavur, the men of the army and town embracing each other. His men refused to return to the town and shoot their fellow citizens.  He then ordered his second in command, Kani Bey, to return to town and execute Kara Hasan. Kani carried out the order and gunned down Hasan and 13 others in cold blood. Hasan's death angered the citizens of Biga. A mob of citizens attacked Kani Bey's home; he escaped initially with the help of a neighbor but was cut down by the mob's bullets shortly after his flight. Hamidi was cornered, trying to link up with other military officers in the area, by Pomaks and tied, beaten, and killed by having his neck snapped.
Anzavur's ranks began to swell as the victory in Biga was consolidated over the following month. A committee of three local notables and paramilitary leaders was organized to handle local issues. Shortly after a former regional inspector named Samih RÄ±fat Horozcu was sent to plead with locals to rejoin the nationalists, his pleas fell on deaf ears.


By the middle of March, a column of 500 nationalist troops was organized and sent to recapture Biga and the surrounding area. Anzavur led the defense against these troops.  Those who followed him, largely Circassians and Pomaks, were mostly armed with sticks and axes. After this defeat, Nationalist officers and soldiers began to desert their posts. Anzavur used this victory to recruit more fighters from the GÃ¶nen area. On April 4, troops led by Anzavur and Gavur Imam entered GÃ¶nen executing and pillaging with little resistance. By the 6th, BandÄ±rma, Karacabey, and Kirmasti had fallen in rapid succession to The Army of Muhammad.
As Anzavur pushed Nationalist leaders in Southern Mamara, he knew the end was near. As the noose tightened, Ãerkes Ethem was called upon to bring the rebellion to heel. Ethem was given 2,000 soldiers to do so. On April 16, Anzavur was dealt a resounding defeat near the village of YahyakÃ¶y.  By April 19, BandÄ±rma had fallen to Ethem, marking the gradual defeat of Anzavur and his forces. By the end of April, The Army of Muhammad had melted away, as at the end of the first rebellion, and Anzavur had returned to Istanbul on an English vessel.


With Anzavur's defeat at YahyakÃ¶y, another revolt had broken out in the AdapazarÄ± region. The leaders of this rebellion were (Berzeg) Safer, (Maan) Koc, and (Maan) Ali. The missteps of nationalist forces allowed the scenario to play out similarly to the events of South Marmara. The danger of the situation was recognized by the Nationalist government and ordered to be put down. Ethem was called upon to do so, fresh from putting down Anzavur's rebellion. His forces retook AdapazarÄ± and Sapanca without a fight. On May 26, Ethem entered the town of DÃ¼zce and executed both (Berzeg) Safer, and (Maan) Koc; (Maan) Ali however managed to escape.


With the outbreak of a revolt in DÃ¼zce, the Ottoman government announced the creation of a new army, the Kuva-i Inzibatiye to put down the nationalist Kuva-yi Milliye. This army was to be composed of 1,000 unemployed soldiers under the command of SÃ¼leyman Åefik Pasha. It was announced on April 26 that Ahmet Anzavur would be given a command in the area. On May 4, SÃ¼leyman Åefik Pasha arrived in Izmit with Anzavur arriving four days later with 500 men he had recruited from Biga.


Anzavur's contributions to the fight were negligible, as he suffered a broken leg in a week of fighting with locals and nationalist forces. His forces continued to fight a while longer but were forced to retreat by the end of June. Anzavur faded into obscurity for about a year, until he began recruiting again. In May 1921, a group of pro-Nationalist paramilitary leaders found out about Anzavur's movements. The leader of the paramilitary groups was Arnavud Rahman. Rahman and his men ambushed and killed Ahmet Anzavur outside of Karabiga.",1,4 June 2006, 15 July 2021,58,0,0

Staiths South Bank is a housing development in Gateshead, England, designed in collaboration with fashion designers Wayne & Gerardine Hemingway (known for their Red or Dead fashion label).


This site occupies land adjacent to the Dunston Staiths on the south bank of the River Tyne in Gateshead.


The Staiths is a large multi-level timber structure built out into the river on a curved planform, originally built to load bulk materials, (particularly coal), from railway carriages on railway tracks into merchant vessels moored alongside.


The curved shape of the Staiths encloses part of the river to form a protected basin. This section of the river is subject to tidal influence and the usable basin area therefore varies with the tide. The mud exposed at low tide is an important wading ground for coastal birds.


After a long period of industrial use throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, including development of a large gasworks for the production of town gas from coal, the site became disused. In order to regenerate the area, Gateshead Council included the site in the Gateshead Garden Festival, held between May and October 1990.


Remediation for the purposes of the Garden Festival was restricted to regrading and capping to provide a suitable medium for planting. This included the use of earth mounding to cover the remaining buried structures, such as gasometer bases.


Following the Garden Festival the site was sold to a subsidiary of the Sir Robert McAlpine civil engineering business. Part of the site was designated an Enterprise Zone in order to encourage new employment uses but repeated marketing over nearly a decade failed to attract any commercial or industrial buyers for the site. Gateshead Council's original intention was that the site would be taken up for a major employment use. Japanese construction equipment manufacturer Komatsu had sponsored the Japanese Garden on the site for the Festival and would have fitted this expectation but concentrated their production capacity in nearby Birtley instead.


After years of lying vacant awaiting a use, a final remarketing exercise was undertaken by local land agents in 1999. This invited offers for any use, with the intention of changing the Council's expectations for an employment use on the site. As a result of this process, the North East region of Wimpey Homes made an acceptable financial offer based on redevelopment of the land for housing.


Initially, use of the land for housing was considered undesirable by the local statutory bodies for two reasons;
the Council's continued wish to protect the site for much needed employment in the area, and;
the Environment Agency's concerns regarding the extent and nature of the remaining contamination


Regarding the protection of the site for a major employer, after almost a decade of marketing and false starts, no employment use was in prospect so this was unnecessarily blocking redevelopment of a significant urban brownfield site. Gateshead Council had been particularly concerned to maintain sites in their area which were large enough to attract a major manufacturing facility. As time went on, the likelihood of such an employer wishing to establish themselves in the area became less and less likely so it became harder for the Council to justify sterilising the land with an unrealistic intended use.


Regarding the EA's concerns, this needed to be addressed by a comprehensive programme of sampling, analysis and risk assessment prior to designing a reclamation scheme. This was put in motion by Wimpey Homes who assembled a project team to carry out pre acquisition due diligence and pre planning consultation. This proceeded despite Gateshead Council's continuing concerns about loss of employment land until the project team was joined by fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, who brought his personal passion for innovation and skills of persuasion to bear on key members and officers of the Council.


As a result of internal reorganisation, Wimpey's interest in the site was then transferred to their newly formed specialist city centre development business, George Wimpey City. While conceptual design work with the Hemingways continued apace, the considerable challenges of achieving a workable remediation scheme were tackled by AIG and Arup in negotiation with the Environment Agency. The central question was whether residential development could take place without removal of all of the underlying contaminated material. After much investigation and testing of the existing ground, a remediation scheme was prepared which removed the isolated hotspots of contamination and cut off pathways from the remaining lower level contamination to the surface and adjoining river, involving a further regrading and capping exercise using clean material imported into the site.


AIG undertook to carry out the remediation with Arup involved in verification of the completed work. AIGs works also included removing many of the large buried obstructions which still remained from the earlier industrial uses and Arup's completion testing included ensuring the bearing capacity of the remediated site was suitable for the intended use. Most importantly, the thickness of the proposed clean capping material was to be measured after being placed to satisfy George Wimpey and Gateshead Council that the work was in compliance with the remediation design.


The twin barriers to development of planning use and contamination are not unusual issues to be overcome for development to take place, however, they were of notable complexity on this particular site and they were only resolved with considerable effort by the professional team involved.


As it happened, neither of these issues were to prove the most contentious barrier to planning consent or implementation, as revealed when the design of the project moved into detailed consultation with the Council.


Wayne and his wife, Gerardine, complimented the existing professional team rather than replacing any part of it, although there was a change of Architect in order to provide a clean break from previous design studies. There remained a need for a team of housing development design professionals as the Hemingways were concept driven and did not claim to be able to provide detailed technical information which would still be required for regulatory approval and construction.


The project team comprised;


Hemingway Design


IDP Partnership, Newcastle upon Tyne (Architects)


Glen Kemp, Gateshead (Landscape Architects)- note that for the purposes of achieving the desired Homezone, Glen Kemp were given design responsibility for the public realm in its entirety, replacing much of the conventional highway design role


Arup, Newcastle (Civil and Structural Engineers)


Hall & Partners, Newcastle upon Tyne (Cost Consultants)


As mentioned previously, the sampling, analysis and design for the remediation of the site was dealt with by specialist sub contractor AIG Remediation, with Arup undertaking a parallel role monitoring post reclamation contamination and ground engineering information.


In addition to the design team, a North East Public Relations firm, Cool Blue PR, were engaged by the developers to assist in managing media interest and the production of marketing material.


The Hemingways' approach was to follow European models of large scale housing, in particular the modern design aesthetic of newbuild housing in Malmo and the use of Homezone shared circulation routes mixing pedestrians with vehicles, as practiced in the Dutch Woonerf. At the time, the development was the largest newbuild Homezone in the UK. This was an ironic turn in the development of this style of shared external circulation space, as these were experimented with in Warrington and other English newbuild housing in the early 1970s, before being taken up on continental Europe and developed into the predominant residential street form in the Netherlands.


The Hemingways' conceptual aesthetic and functional ideas were interpreted into a gridlike circulation layout creating horseshoes of around 20 terraced properties backing onto a shared garden space, enclosed & gated to provide privacy and security. These groupings around shared gardens were intended to create a tangible sense of neighbourhood, each grouping and  garden being different from the next.


Initial pre-planning consultation with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, (the Government's advisor on architecture, urban design and public space), produced some adverse comments on the 'grid like' street pattern which had resulted from creating these groups of homes. Much time was spent considering whether the grid pattern would be apparent at street level as many of the long vistas were broken by staggers in junctions. In the event, this combination of deliberately blocked long views and a 'busy' public realm design, limited the perception of the overall layout for anyone stood within the Homezone or garden areas.


While the Hemingways' influence was to cover all aspects of the project, Gerardine was particularly effective in selecting external materials which were interesting for both their colour and texture. Research into the durability and cost of the proposed materials was often inconclusive as not only were they not already in use for housing construction, they were often not even available in the UK.


Despite the elevational treatments being unconventional, Gateshead Council exerted relatively little influence on these and instead concentrated their comments and concerns on the public realm design, most particularly the Homezone areas. It was these Homezones that became the single most contentious aspect of the scheme, involving frequent meetings of 12 to 15 people, (with representatives from the Council, George Wimpey City and the professional team), solely to discuss how the Homezones could function without compromising safety.


The Homezone, despite being prototyped in the UK in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was at the time alien to most of established highway design practice in the UK. The much evolved and refined Dutch version, the Woonerf, is supported by legislation which gives pedestrians priority over vehicles within these shared streets. This inverts the expectation of UK motorists, who would expect a pedestrian in the carriageway to give way to a vehicle.


Resolving these legislative differences involved the involvement of central Government officers who were already aware of various other Homezone projects around the UK. All of these projects, (whether newbuild or remodelling existing streets),  suffered from a mismatch between their design intent to create a higher quality of public realm which could be actively used by residents with the existing legislation that presumed anyone standing in the road was inviting an accident.


The support of central Government included an award of Homezone grant towards the additional costs involved in the creation of a more complex public realm. This grant was specific to external works costs in the first phase of the development so would provide early support for the design principles being established for the project as a whole.


It was only after many months of negotiation and compromise that a workable public realm design was achieved. The key to finally obtaining the Council's consent was the combination of a sophisticated design solution prepared jointly by Glen Kemp and Arup with a management regime prepared by George Wimpey Citynd CPM, the Managing Agents who would act on behalf of residents to maintain the unadopted and communally owned elements of the development.


Once planning consent was obtained, the remediation contract was placed with AIG and work began. The masterplan for the development was divided into phases with the initial construction intended to take place to either side of the new main access off Team Street towards the east end of the site. This access included provision for the dedicated route of the new high speed bus link between Gateshead town centre and the MetroCentre.


As AIG's works moved westwards across the site, their working area was redefined and fenced to allow construction to begin of the initial phase of housing.


The development had received much local publicity during the planning process due to the involvement of the Hemingways. This initial interest from potential buyers enabled an early marketing launch of the first phase of the project, i.e. selling off plan. While this early selling process was becoming the norm for large capital intensive projects which would be attractive to investors, such as city centre apartments, it was not common practice for the sale of family/'estate' housing. This was partly due to a reluctance by developers to commit to selling prices too early in the development programme, thereby losing out on any possible increases either due to inflation or by demonstrating the actual product using an onsite showhome.


The initial sales release was launched at the Marriott Hotel in Gateshead. Such was the interest that had built up, based mostly on press coverage of the Hemingways' involvement, that potential buyers queued for many hours before the evening launch and most of the first release was sold out in a few hours, Sales staff working into the early hours with buyers to complete reservation paperwork. In order to limit the influence of speculators, buyers were restricted to a maximum of two properties each. The success of this initial launch event prompted an early review of selling prices, which were increased for the second release.


The development has won a number of national and regional awards, which include:


RIBA Housing Design Award 2005 - Best large project
CABE Building for Life 2005 - Silver Award and Best Residential Project
Building Magazine - Best Housing-Led Regeneration Project
Northumbria in Bloom - Silver Gilt Award and Urban Regeneration Category Winner
RICS North East Renaissance Awards 2006 - Residential Category Winner


Staiths South Bank achieved the highest rating of any large scale scheme in a recent CABE audit.


Despite the acclaim that the development has received from the design community, the complex design and management of the public realm has caused difficulties for the leaseholders. Most obviously, maintenance of such an environment is an expensive operation placing severe pressure on service charges and this has created a tension between leaseholders and the Managing Agents. These remain relatively affordable properties whose buyers may not be willing or able to pay significant additional costs to maintain the estate as a whole.


These maintenance issues are combined with the difficulty of ensuring that vehicles are parked within areas designated for parking rather than obstructing the circulation space within the Homezone. As is often the case, car ownership exceeds that envisaged by the design team so there are more vehicles than allowed for. The usual design/regulatory approach is restrict parking provision to restrict car use, in practice residents tend not to accept this restriction and find space to park wherever they can, preferably as close to their front door as possible. A good example of design and regulation failing to recognise the realities of human behaviour.


The challenge for future Homezone projects is to:


1. Achieve a public realm which is usable for shared circulation and play while being affordable in relation to the ability to pay of the residents/leaseholders.


2. Achieve a workable balance between control of the vehicle to enhance the value of the public realm for non drivers and realistic parking provision.",0,14 November 2008, 4 July 2021,52,0,0

The Spanish name for the Pinacate Peaks geographic feature is the Sierra Pinacate, which is used in their homeland of Mexico.


The Pinacate Peaks lie just north of the fishing resort of Puerto PeÃ±asco.  The tallest of the peaks is Cerro del Pinacate (also called Volcan Santa Clara), elevation 3,904 feet (1,190 m).  The Mexican Spanish word pinacate is derived from the Nahuatl word for the endemic desert stink beetle, pinacatl.


The volcanoes here have erupted here sporadically since about 4Â million years ago, probably in association with the opening of the Gulf of California.  The most recent volcanic activity was about 11,000 years ago.  The Pinacate Desert is home to the largest sand dunes of the Americas.


A variety of flora and fauna occur in the Pinacate Mountains, including the sculptural Elephant Tree,  Bursera microphylla.


Padre Eusebio Kino, founder of many Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert, explored here in 1698 and several times later.


NASA sent astronauts here starting in 1965 for geologic training, given the similarity of the terrain to the lunar surface, and included training models of lunar surface equipment.  Apollo 14's Alan Shepard and Ed Mitchell, and Apollo 17's Jack Schmitt trained here in Feb. 1970.


The El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve is a biosphere reserve, in the spanish language Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar, managed by the Mexican Federal Government's SEMARNAT - the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the government of the  State of Sonora's IMADES agency.

According to Jenny Rowland, 'most critics would classify it among the most sophisticated and moving all the early englynion poems'; it is 'the classic example' of meditative, lyric, at least implicitly religious, early Welsh poetry.


The poem gradually reveals itself as a monologue by a person who is ill, probably with leprosy, as he laments his exile from society and the ruin of his homestead. It is characterised by the use of the natural world as a frame and reference point for human emotion, shifts of focus from the speaker's observations on his particular situation and gnomic observations on life in general, and jumps from one subject to another producing tantalising juxtapositions. The poem has frequently been compared (and contrasted) with the roughly contemporaneous Old English poems The Wanderer and The Seafarer.


The poem is attested principally in the late fourteenth-century Red Book of Hergest (p. 514, column 1034 line 24âcolumn 1035 end). It was also included in the White Book of Rhydderch, but is now lost due to damage to the manuscript. However, it is attested in two later manuscripts descended from the White Book, Peniarth 111 (made by John Jones of Gellillyfdy in 1607), whose spelling is very close to the White Book's, and London, British Library, Add. MS 31055 (made by Thomas Wiliems in 1596), which is a less conservative copy. National Library of Wales 4973 section b contains the poem. Its relationship to the other manuscripts is complex and may represent a conflation of multiple medieval sources, but it seems to have at least some independent value as a witness to the lost archetype of the poem. It is fairly clear that all these manuscripts descend from a lost common original, to which they are all fairly similar, making the creation of a critical edition of the poems relatively straightforward. In all the independent witnesses, Claf Abercuawg precedes the cycle of englyn-poems known as Canu Llywarch Hen; indeed, in the White Book, Claf Abercuawg is entitled 'Englynion Mabclaf ap Llywarch' (âenglynion of Mabclaf son of Llywarchâ). However, modern scholars do not see it as linked to the Llywarch Hen material.


Despite surviving first in fourteenth-century manuscripts and in largely Middle Welsh orthography, the poem is thought to have been composed in Old Welsh and transmitted orally and/or in manuscript, due to its archaic style and occasionally archaic spelling. Jenny Rowland judges that it dates from between the mid and late ninth century.


The poem was translated into English by the poet Edward Thomas in his influential book Beautiful Wales (1905). It was also influential on R. S. Thomas, who gave a lecture entitled Abercuawg in 1977, referring several times to Claf Abercuawg.


As edited by Ifor Williams and translated by Jenny Rowland, the poem runs:


Kyfreu eichyawc yn dolyd Cuawc.


a loud song in the meadows of Cuawg.


Woe to the sick man who hears them constantly.


Llewychyt lloer; oer deweint.

105987,Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_%26_Martin%27s_Laugh-In,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rowan_&_Martin's_Laugh-In&action=info,"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (often simply referred to as Laugh-In) is an American sketch comedy television program that ran for 140 episodes from January 22, 1968, to March 12, 1973, on the NBC television network, hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. It originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967, and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8 pm (ET). It quickly became the most popular television show in the United States.


The title of the show was a play on the 1960s hippie culture ""love-ins"" or the counterculture ""be-ins"", terms that were derived from ""sit-ins"" that were common in protests associated with civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the time. In 2002, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In was ranked number 42 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.


Laugh-In had its roots in the humor of vaudeville and burlesque, but its most direct influences were Olsen and Johnson's comedies (such as the free-form Broadway revue Hellzapoppin'), the innovative television works of Ernie Kovacs, and the topical satire of That Was The Week That Was. The show was characterized by a rapid-fire series of gags and sketches, many of which were politically charged or contained sexual innuendo. The co-hosts continued the exasperated straight man (Rowan) and ""dumb guy"" (Martin) act which they had established as nightclub comics.[pageÂ needed] The show featured Gary Owens as the on-screen announcer and permanent castmember Ruth Buzzi; longer-tenured cast members included Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Goldie Hawn, Arte Johnson, Jo Anne Worley, Alan Sues, Lily Tomlin, Johnny Brown, Dennis Allen and Richard Dawson.


Each episode followed a somewhat similar format, often including recurring sketches. The show started after the intro and a batch of shorts skits that served as cold open with a short dialogue between Rowan and Martin. Shortly afterward, Rowan would intone: ""C'mon Dick, let's go to the party, You're all invited!â. This live to tape segment comprised all cast members and occasional surprise celebrities dancing before a 1960s ""mod"" party backdrop, delivering one- and two-line jokes interspersed with a few bars of dance music (later adopted on The Muppet Show, which had a recurring segment that was similar to ""The Cocktail Party"" with absurd moments from characters). This was similar in format to the ""Word Dance"" segments of A Thurber Carnival. The show then proceeded through rapid-fire comedy bits, taped segments, and recurring sketches.


At the end of every show, Rowan turned to his co-host and said, ""Say good night, Dick"", to which Martin replied, ""Good night, Dick!"". The show then featured cast members' opening panels in a psychedelically painted ""joke wall"" and telling jokes, After which, the show would continue with one final batch of skits, before drawing to a close.  After the applause died, executive producer George Schlatter's solitary clapping continued even as the screen turned blank and the production logo, network chimes, and NBC logo appeared.


Although episodes included most of the above segments, the arrangement of the segments was often interchanged. The show often featured guest stars. Sometimes, the guest had a prominent spot in the program, at other times the guest would pop in for short ""quickies"" (one- or two-line jokes) interspersed throughout the show â as was done most famously by Richard Nixon, when running for president.


Ruth Buzzi, Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Larry Hovis, Arte Johnson, Ken Berry, Pamela Austin, Barbara Feldon and Jo Anne Worley appeared in the pilot special from 1967. (Goldie Hawn, who was under contract to Good Morning World at the time of the pilot, joined for season 1 in 1968 after that show was canceled). Only the two hosts, announcer Gary Owens, and Buzzi, Carne, Gibson, and Johnson, were in all 14 episodes of season one. Eileen Brennan, Hovis, and Roddy Maude-Roxby left after the first season.


The second season had a handful of new people, including Alan Sues, Dave Madden, and Chelsea Brown. All of the new cast members from season two left at the end of that season except Sues, who stayed on until 1972. At the end of the 1968â69 season, Carne chose not to renew her contract, although she did make appearances during 1969â1970.


The third season had several new people who only stayed on for that season: Teresa Graves, Jeremy Lloyd, Pamela Rodgers, and Byron Gilliam. Lily Tomlin joined in the middle of the season. Jo Anne Worley, Goldie Hawn, and Judy Carne left after the season.


The 1970â71 season brought new additions to the cast include tall, lanky, sad-eyed Dennis Allen, who alternately played quietly zany characters and the straight man for anybody's jokes; comic actress Ann Elder, who also contributed to scripts, tap dancer Barbara Sharma, and Johnny Brown.


Arte Johnson, who created many memorable characters, insisted on star billing, apart from the rest of the cast. The producer mollified him, but had announcer Gary Owens read Johnson's credit as a separate sentence: ""Starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin! And Arte Johnson! With Ruth BuzziÂ ..."" This maneuver gave Johnson star billing, but made it sound like he was still part of the ensemble cast. Johnson and Henry Gibson left the show during the fourth season; they were replaced by former Hogan's Heroes stars Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis, both of whom had appeared occasionally in the first season. However, the loss of Johnson's many popular characters caused ratings to drop further.


The show celebrated its 100th episode during the 1971â72 season, with Carne, Worley, Johnson, Gibson, Graves, and Tiny Tim all returning for the festivities. John Wayne was on hand for his first cameo appearance since 1968.


For the show's final season (1972â73), Rowan and Martin assumed the executive producer roles from George Schlatter (known on-air as ""CFG"", which stood for ""Crazy Fucking George""), and Ed Friendly. Except for holdovers Dawson, Owens, Buzzi, Allen, and only occasional appearances from Tomlin, a new cast was brought in. This final season featured comedian Patti Deutsch, folksy singer-comedian Jud Strunk, ventriloquist act Willie Tyler and Lester, and giddy Goldie Hawn lookalike Sarah Kennedy. Former regular Jo Anne Worley returned for two guest appearances, including the final episode. These last shows never aired in the edited half-hour reruns syndicated (through Lorimar Productions) to local stations in 1983 and later on Nick at Nite in 1987, although they were included when the program was rerun on the Decades over-the-air television channel in 2017.


Of over three dozen entertainers to join the cast, only Rowan, Martin, Owens, and Buzzi were there from beginning to end. However, Owens was not in the 1967 pilot and Buzzi missed two first-season episodes.


The writers for Laugh-In were: George Schlatter, Larry Hovis (pilot only), Digby Wolfe, Paul W. Keyes, Hugh Wedlock, Jr. and Allan Manings, Chris Bearde (credited as Chris Beard), Phil Hahn and Jack Hanrahan, Coslough Johnson (Arte Johnson's twin brother), Marc London and David Panich, Dave Cox, Jim Carlson, Jack Mendelsohn and Jim Mulligan, Lorne Michaels and Hart Pomerantz, Jack Douglas, Jeremy Lloyd, John Carsey, Dennis Gren, Gene Farmer, John Rappaport and Stephen Spears, Jim Abell and Chet Dowling, Barry Took, E. Jack Kaplan, Larry Siegel, Jack S. Margolis, Don Reo and Allan Katz, Richard Goren (also credited as Rowby Greeber and Rowby Goren), Winston Moss, Gene Perret and Bill Richmond, Jack Wohl, Bob Howard and Bob DeVinney. Script supervisors for Laugh-In included Digby Wolfe (comedy consultant, season 1), Phil Hahn and Jack Hanrahan (season 2), Allan Manings (season 3), Marc London and David Panich (seasons 3â6), and Jim Mulligan (season 6).


The musical director for Laugh-In was Ian Bernard. He wrote the opening theme music, ""Inquisitive Tango"" (used in Season 1 and again permanently from season 4), plus the infamous ""What's the news across the nation"" number. He wrote all the musical ""play-ons"" that introduced comedy sketches like Lily Tomlin's character, Edith Ann, the little girl who sat in a giant rocking chair, and Arte Johnson's old man character, Tyrone, who always got hit with a purse. He also appeared in many of the cocktail scenes where he directed the band as they stopped and started between jokes. Composer-lyricist Billy Barnes wrote all of the original musical production numbers in the show, and often appeared on-camera, accompanying Johnson, Buzzi, Worley, or Sues, on a golden grand piano. Barnes was the creator of the famous Billy Barnes Revues of the 1950s and 1960s, and composed such popular hits as ""I Stayed Too Long at the Fair"", recorded by Barbra Streisand and the jazz standard ""Something Cool"" recorded by June Christy.[citation needed]


The show was recorded at NBC's Burbank facility using two-inch quadruplex videotape. As computer-controlled online editing had not been invented at the time, post-production video editing of the montage was achieved by the error-prone method of visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid and cutting it with a razor blade or guillotine cutter and splicing with adhesive tape, in a manner similar to film editing. This had the incidental benefit of ensuring the preservation of the master tape, as a spliced tape could not be recycled for further use. Laugh-In editor Arthur Schneider won an Emmy Award in 1968 for his pioneering use of the ""jump cut"" â the unique editing style in which a sudden cut from one shot to another was made without a fade-out.[pageÂ needed]


When the series was restored for airing by the Trio Cable Network in 1996, the aforementioned edits became problematic for the editors, as the adhesive used on the source tape had deteriorated during 20+ years of storage, making many of the visual elements at the edit points unusable. This was corrected in digital re-editing by removing the problematic video at the edit point and then slowing down the video image just before the edit point; time-expanding the slowed-down section long enough to allot enough time to seamlessly reinsert the audio portion from the removed portion of video.





Frequently recurring Laugh-In sketches included:


The first season featured some of the first music videos seen on network TV, with cast members appearing in films set to the music of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Bee Gees, the Temptations, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the First Edition.


During the September 16, 1968, episode, Richard Nixon, running for president, appeared for a few seconds with a disbelieving vocal inflection, asking ""Sock it to me?"" Nixon was not doused or assaulted. An invitation was extended to Nixon's opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but he declined. According to George Schlatter, the show's creator, ""Humphrey later said that not doing it may have cost him the election"", and ""[Nixon] said the rest of his life that appearing on Laugh-In is what got him elected. And I believe that. And I've had to live with that."" In an episode of the ill-fated 1977 revival, a Nixon impersonator says, ""I invited the American people to sock-it-to-me.... you can stop now"".[citation needed]


After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in Cactus Flower, Goldie Hawn made a guest appearance in the third episode of the fourth season.  She began the episode as an arrogant snob of an actress; however, a bucket of water thrown at her transformed her back to her giggling dumb blonde persona.


On multiple occasions, producer George Schlatter attempted to get William F. Buckley Jr. to appear on the show, only to be refused each time until he suddenly agreed to an appearance. In the episode that aired December 28, 1970, Buckley appeared in an unusual sit-down segment (portions of which were scattered throughout the episode) flanked by Rowan and Martin and fielding questions from the cast (which included Lily Tomlin doing her Fast Talker shtick) and giving humorous answers to each. Near the end, when Rowan asked Buckley why he finally agreed to appear on the show, Buckley explained that Schlatter had written him ""an irresistable letter"" in which he promised to fly Buckley out to Burbank ""in an airplane with two right wings"". At the end, Rowan thanked him for appearing, noting that ""you can't be that smart without having a sense of humor, and you have a delightful one"".


In addition to those already mentioned, the show created numerous catchphrases:


A humor magazine tie-in, Laugh-In Magazine, was published for one year (12 issues: October 1968 through October 1969âno issue was published December 1968), and a 1968-1972 syndicated newspaper comic strip was drawn by Roy Doty and eventually collected for a paperback reprint.


The Laugh-In trading cards from Topps had a variety of items, such as a card with a caricature of Jo Anne Worley with a large open mouth. With a die-cut hole, the card became interactive; a finger could be inserted through the hole to simulate Worley's tongue. Little doors opened on Joke Wall cards to display punchlines.


On Letters to Laugh-In, a short-lived spin-off daytime show hosted by Gary Owens, cast members read jokes sent in by viewers, which were scored by applause meter. The eventual winning joke was read by actress Jill St. John: ""What do you get when you cross an elephant with a jar of peanut butter? A 500 pound sandwich that sticks to the roof of your mouth!""


A cross-promotional episode of I Dream of Jeannie (""The Biggest Star in Hollywood"", February 1969) features Judy Carne, Arte Johnson, Gary Owens, and producer George Schlatter playing themselves in a story about Jeannie being sought after to appear on Laugh-In.


In 1969, a Laugh-In View-Master packet was issued by General Aniline and Film (GAF); The packet featured 21 3D images from the show.


The horror spoof film The Maltese Bippy (1969) starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin was loosely related to the series. Pamela Rodgers was the only Laugh-In cast member to co-star in the film.


In 1969, Sears, Roebuck and Company produced a 15-minute short, Freeze-In, which starred series regulars Judy Carne and Arte Johnson. Made to capitalize on the popularity of the series, the short was made for Sears salesmen to introduce the new Kenmore freezer campaign. A dancing, bikini-clad Carne provided the opening titles with tattoos on her body.


Two LPs of material from the show were released: the first on Epic Records (FXS-15118, 1968); the second, entitled Laugh-In '69, on Reprise Records (RS 6335, 1969).


Between 2003 and 2004, Rhino Entertainment Company (under its Rhino Retrovision classic TV entertainment brand), under license from the rightsholder at the time, SFM Entertainment, released two The Best Of releases of the show, each containing six episodes presented in its original, uncut broadcast version. In 2003, Rhino, through direct-response marketing firm Guthy-Renker, also released a series of DVDs subtitled The Sock-It-To-Me Collection, with each DVD containing two episodes.


On June 19, 2017, Time Life, another direct-response marketer, released Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time, in a deal with current rightsholder Proven Entertainment. The 38-disc set contains all 140 episodes of the series, complete and uncut, restored and remastered as well as many bonus features and a special 32-page collector's book.


On September 5, 2017, Time Life began releasing individual complete season sets on DVD, beginning with the first season. This was followed by the second season on January 9, 2018, and the third season on March 6, 2018. The fourth season was released on May 8, 2018. Season 5 was released on July 10, 2018. Finally, Season 6 was released on September 4, 2018.


TV season, ranking, average viewers per episode


In 1977, Schlatter and NBC briefly revived the property as a series of specials â titled simply Laugh-In â with a new cast. The standout was a then-unknown Robin Williams, whose starring role on ABC's Mork & Mindy one year later prompted NBC to rerun the specials as a summer series in 1979. Also featured were Wayland and Madame (as well as his other puppet, ""Jiffy""), former child evangelist Marjoe Gortner, former Barney Miller actress June Gable, and Good Times actor Ben Powers. Rowan and Martin, who owned part of the Laugh-In franchise, were not involved in this project. They sued Schlatter for using the format without their permission, and won a judgment of $4.6 million in 1980.


In 2019, Netflix produced a special tribute to the original series entitled, Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate. Tomlin, Buzzi and Worley appeared in the special.

14670730,Apollo archetype,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_archetype,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apollo_archetype&action=info,"The Apollo archetype personifies the aspect of the personality that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over feeling, distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective intuition.


Early in the 20th century, Carl Gustav Jung sought to find a word that could describe the innate patterns of behaviour that govern our lives. Thus he introduced the term âArchetypesâ into modern psychology. Jung described archetypes as distinct themes manifesting in the fantasies and behaviour of his patients, and found these same themes visibly rendered in the arts, religions, myths, architecture, and social customs of all peoples. Because he did not want the term âarchetypesâ to become yet another intellectual abstraction, Jung advanced various mythic images to illustrate them. For instance, the goddess Demeter is a presentation of the archetypal mother; Zeus an archetypal father; Apollo the archetypal intellectual, and so on. Jung went on to personify many archetypes by using general expressions such as 'the Great Motherâ, 'Old Wise Manâ, 'Shadow archetypeâ, etc. which have now become standard expressions in the field of analytical psychology. Jung writes âThe fact that the unconscious spontaneously personifies is the reason why I have taken over these personifications in my terminology and formulated them in namesâ.


As with other archetypes, the Apollo archetype is not gender-specific. ""Women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us allâ¦ There are gods and goddesses in every person.""


In addition to the many positive aspects of the Apollo archetype such as order, reason, moderation, harmoniousness, and unemotional perfection, archetypal psychologist James Hillman suggests that the archetype may also manifest as a negative potential if it becomes overly dominant: ""Apollo certainly presents a pattern that is disastrous, destructive for psychological life, cut off from everything that has to do with feminine ways, whether Cassandra or Creusa or Daphne â whomever he touches goes wrong â so that you have the feeling that Apollo simply doesn't belong where there is psyche.""


Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Shinoda-Bolen writes:

68542824,1586 LimaâCallao earthquake,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1586_Lima%E2%80%93Callao_earthquake,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1586_LimaâCallao_earthquake&action=info,"The 1586 LimaâCallao earthquake (Spanish: Terremoto de Lima y Callao de 1586) occurred on July 9 along the coast of Peru, near the capital Lima. A section of the Peruvian coast, stretching from CaravelÃ­ to Trujillo, north to south, was decimated by the earthquake. Major destruction occurred in the capital city Lima as well. The estimatd moment magnitude (Mwâ¯) 8.1 earthquake triggered a locally damaging tsunami of up to 5 meters. This was the first major earthquake to strike the city Lima since its establishment in 1535.


The coast of Peru lies a 7,000-km-long convergent boundary where the oceanic Nazca Plate subducts or dives beneath the continental South American Plate. The PeruâChile trench marks the location where the two plates meet and converge. Subduction at the plate boundary rate varies throughout the 7,000 km length, at 65 mm/yr towards the north, and up to 80 mm/yr in the south. The presence of active subduction can produce large earthquakes when elastic energy along the plate boundary (megathrust) is released suddenly after decades or centuries of accumulated strain. Earthquakes rupturing the megathrust are known as megathrust earthquakes; capable of generating tsunamis when there is sufficient and sudden uplift of the seafloor, in turn lead to the sudden displacement of the sea.


The shock from the quake was felt at 19:00 local time on July 9, a Wednesday. The shock was accompanied by loud noises which frightened many residents, driving them out of their homes. Most residents were able to evacuate in time during the earthquake, such that the death toll was small, although there were many individuals that suffered injuries. When the quake struck, many of the residents were already out in the streets or gardens where they were safe from collapes. Damage and effects from the earthquake occurred over a 1,000 km stretch by 120 km wide area near the coast. THe earthquake was also felt in the cities Cusco and HuÃ¡nuco.


The earthquake reportedly collaped the towers of a cathedral in the city of Lima. Significant rockslides occurred at Cerro San Cristobal (es) in the RÃ­mac District of Lima Province. The earthquake also severely damaged the residence of Fernando Torres de Portugal y MesÃ­a, the then viceroy of Peru. Ground fissures formed in the city when the shaking was ongoing.


The associated tsunami was documented by the viceroy of Peru in which he said the waves picked up and smashed homes, and inundated up to 250 meters inland. Even when the waves retreated, the some parts of the city was so severely flooded that it was impossible to ride a horse through. At Callao, the earthquake and tsunami destroyed many docks and warehouses. Ships were dragged far inland during the tsunami inundation. Many trees and bushes were uprooted from the ground and deposited far inland by the tsunami.


The 1586 earthquake ruptures a 175-km-long section of the Peru-Chile subduction zone, similar in size to the 1974 earthquake, which had an estimated moment magnitude (Mwâ¯) of 8.1, and a tsunami magnitude (Mtâ¯) of 8.5.


Older descriptions of the tsunami having a height of 24 to 26 meters have been debunked and concluded as exaggerations. A more accurate height of the tsunami has been estimated at 5 meters.


The tsunami was also confused as being an orphan tsunami reported along Japan's Sanriku coast due to erroneous cataloging of historical tsunamis, which also led to the confusion that it was from the 1586 TenshÅ earthquake; a large Japanese earthquake. The presence of a tsunami at the Sanriku coast however, was reported in June 1585, now thought to be from the 1585 Aleutian Islands earthquake. At a monument in Tokura village near the Sanriku coast in Miyagi Prefecture, a stone monument stated that a tsunami between 1 and 2 meters in height struck the coast; the tsunami has been inferred to be of the 1585 event. Modelling of the tsunami from the 1586 earthquake in Peru suggest the tsunami was approximately 6 cm.",1,23 August 2021, 2 September 2021,13,2,2

532471,White swamphen,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_swamphen,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_swamphen&action=info,"The white swamphen (Porphyrio albus), also known as the Lord Howe swamphen, Lord Howe gallinule or white gallinule, is an extinct species of rail which lived on Lord Howe Island, east of Australia. It was first encountered when the crews of British ships visited the island between 1788 and 1790, and all contemporary accounts and illustrations were produced during this time. Today, two skins exist: the holotype in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, and another in Liverpool's World Museum. Although historical confusion has existed about the provenance of the specimens and the classification and anatomy of the bird, it is now thought to have been a distinct species endemic to Lord Howe Island and most similar to the Australasian swamphen. Subfossil bones have also been discovered since.


The white swamphen was 36Â cm (14Â in) to 55Â cm (22Â in) long. Both known skins have mainly-white plumage, although the Liverpool specimen also has dispersed blue feathers. This is unlike other swamphens, but contemporary accounts indicate birds with all-white, all-blue, and mixed blue-and-white plumage. The chicks were black, becoming blue and then white as they aged. Although this has been interpreted as due to albinism, it may have been progressive greying in which feathers lose their pigment with age. The bird's bill, frontal shield and legs were red, and it had a claw (or spur) on its wing. Little was recorded about the white swamphen's behaviour. It may not have been flightless, but was probably a poor flier. This and its docility made the bird easy prey for visiting humans, who killed it with sticks. Reportedly once common, the species may have been hunted to extinction before 1834, when Lord Howe Island was settled.


Lord Howe Island is a small, remote island about 600 kilometres (370Â mi) east of Australia. Ships first arrived on the island in 1788, including two which supplied the British penal colony on Norfolk Island and three transport ships of the British First Fleet. When HMSÂ Supply passed the island, the ship's commander named it after First Lord of the Admiralty Richard Howe. Crews of the visiting ships captured native birds (including white swamphens), and all contemporary descriptions and depictions of the species were made between 1788 and 1790. The bird was first mentioned by the master of HMS Supply, David Blackburn, in a 1788 letter to a friend. Other accounts and illustrations were produced by Arthur Bowes Smyth, the fleet's naval officer and surgeon who drew the first known illustration of the species; Arthur Phillip, governor of New South Wales; and George Raper, midshipman of HMSÂ Sirius. Secondhand accounts also exist, and at least ten contemporary illustrations are known. The accounts indicate that the population varied, and individual bird plumage was white, blue, or mixed blue-and-white.


In 1790, the white swamphen was scientifically described and named by the surgeon John White in a book about his time in New South Wales. He named the bird Fulica alba, the specific name being derived from the Latin word for white (albus). White found the bird most similar to the western swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio, then in the genus Fulica). Although he apparently never visited Lord Howe Island, White may have questioned sailors and based some of his description on earlier accounts. He said he had described a skin at the Leverian Museum, and his book included an illustration of the specimen by the artist Sarah Stone. It is uncertain when (and how) the specimen arrived at the museum. This skin, the holotype specimen of the species, was purchased by the Natural History Museum of Vienna in 1806 and is catalogued as specimen NMW 50.761. The naturalist John Latham listed the bird as Gallinula alba in a later 1790 work, and wrote that it may have been a variety of purple swamphen (or ""gallinule"").


One other white swamphen specimen is in Liverpool's World Museum, where it is catalogued as specimen WML D3213. Obtained by the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, it later entered the collection of the traveller William Bullock and was purchased by Lord Stanley; Stanley's son donated it to Liverpool's public museums in 1850. Although White said that the first specimen was obtained from Lord Howe Island, the provenance of the second has been unclear; it was originally said to have come from New Zealand, resulting in taxonomic confusion. Phillip wrote that the bird could also be found on Norfolk Island and elsewhere, but Latham said it could be found only on Norfolk Island. When the first specimen was sold by the Leverian Museum, it was listed as coming from New Holland (which Australia was called at the time)âperhaps because it was sent from Sydney. A note by the naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard on a contemporary illustration of the bird by Captain John Hunter inaccurately stated that it only lived on Ball's Pyramid, an islet off Lord Howe Island.


The Zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck assigned the white swamphen to the swamphen genus Porphyrio as P. albus in 1820, and the zoologist George Robert Gray considered it an albino variety of the Australasian swamphen (P. melanotus) as P. m. varius alba in 1844. The belief that the bird was simply an albino was held by several later writers, and many failed to notice that White cited Lord Howe Island as the origin of the Vienna specimen. In 1860 and 1873, the ornithologist August von Pelzeln said that the Vienna specimen had come from Norfolk Island, and assigned the species to the genus Notornis as N. alba; the takahÄ (P. hochstetteri) of New Zealand was also placed in that genus at the time. In 1873, the naturalist Osbert Salvin agreed that the Lord Howe Island bird was similar to the takahÄ, although he had apparently never seen the Vienna specimen, basing his conclusion on a drawing provided by von Pelzeln. Salvin included a takahÄ-like illustration of the Vienna specimen by the artist John Gerrard Keulemans, based on von Pelzeln's drawing, in his article.


In 1875, the ornithologist George Dawson Rowley noted differences between the Vienna and Liverpool specimens and named a new species based on the latter: P. stanleyi, named after Lord Stanley. He believed that the Liverpool specimen was a juvenile from Lord Howe Island or New Zealand, and continued to believe that the Vienna specimen was from Norfolk Island. Despite naming the new species, Rowley considered the possibility that P. stanleyi was an albino Australasian swamphen and considered the Vienna bird more similar to the takahÄ. In 1901, the ornithologist Henry Ogg Forbes had the Liverpool specimen dismounted so he could examine it for damage. Forbes found it similar enough to the Vienna specimen to belong to the same species, N. alba. The zoologist Walter Rothschild considered the two species distinct from each other in 1907, but placed them both in the genus Notornis. Rothschild thought that the image published by Phillip in 1789 depicted N. stanleyi from Lord Howe Island, and the image published by White in 1790 showed N. alba from Norfolk Island. He disagreed that the specimens were albinos, thinking instead that they were evolving into a white species. Rothschild published an illustration of N. alba by Keulemans where it is similar to a takahÄ, inaccurately showing it with dark primary feathers, although the Vienna specimen on which it was based is all white. In 1910, the ornithologist Tom Iredale demonstrated that there was no proof of the white swamphen existing anywhere but on Lord Howe Island and noted that early visitors to Norfolk Island (such as Captain James Cook and Lieutenant Philip Gidley King) did not mention the bird. In 1913, after examining the Vienna specimen, Iredale concluded that the bird belonged in the genus Porphyrio and did not resemble the takahÄ.


In 1928, the ornithologist Gregory Mathews discussed a 1790 painting by Raper which he thought differed enough from P. albus in proportions and colouration that he named a new species based on it: P. raperi. Mathews also considered P. albus distinct enough to warrant a new genus, Kentrophorina, due to having a (or spur) on one wing. In 1936, he conceded that P. raperi was a synonym of P. albus. The ornithologist Keith Alfred Hindwood agreed that the bird was an albino P. melanotus in 1932, and pointed out that the naturalists Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster (his son) did not record the bird when Cook's ship visited Norfolk Island in 1774. In 1940, Hindwood found the white swamphen so closely related to the Australasian swamphen that he considered them subspecies of the same species: P. albus albus and P. albus melanotus (since albus is the older name). Hindwood suggested that the population on Lord Howe Island was white; blue Australasian swamphens occasionally arrived (stragglers from elsewhere have been found on the island) and bred with the white birds, accounting for the blue and partially-blue individuals in the old accounts. He also pointed out that Australasian swamphens are prone to white feathering. In 1941, the biologist Ernst Mayr proposed that the white swamphen was a partially-albinistic population of Australasian swamphens. Mayr suggested that the blue swamphens remaining on Lord Howe Island were not stragglers, but had survived because they were less conspicuous than the white ones. In 1967, the ornithologist James Greenway also considered the white swamphen a subspecies (with P. stanleyi a synonym) and considered the white individuals albinos. He suggested that the similarities between the wing feathers of the white swamphen and the takahÄ were due to parallel evolution in two isolated populations of reluctant fliers.


The ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley found the white swamphen to be intermediate between the takahÄ and the purple swamphen in 1977, based on patterns of the leg-scutes, and reported that X-rays of bones also showed similarities with the takahÄ. He considered only the Vienna specimen to be a white swamphen, whereas he considered the Liverpool specimen to be an albino Australasian swamphen (listing P. stanleyi  as a junior synonym of that bird) from New Zealand. In 1991, the ornithologist Ian Hutton reported subfossil bones of the white swamphen. Hutton agreed that the birds described as having white-and-blue feathers were hybrids between the white swamphen and the Australasian swamphen, an idea also considered by the ornithologists Barry Taylor and Ber van Perlo in 2000. In 2000, the writer Errol Fuller said that since swamphens are widespread colonists, it would be expected that populations would evolve similarly to the takahÄ when they found refuges without mammals (losing flight and becoming bulkier with stouter legs, for example); this was the case with the white swamphen. Fuller suggested that they could be called ""white takahÄs"", which had been alluded to earlier; the white birds may have been a colour morph of the population, or the blue birds may have been Australasian swamphens which associated with the white birds.


In 2015, the biologists Juan C. Garcia-R. and Steve A. Trewick analysed the DNA of the purple swamphens. They found that the white swamphen was most closely related to the Philippine swamphen (P. pulverulentus), and the black-backed swamphen (P. indicus) more closely related to both than to other species in its region. Garcia-R. and Trewick used DNA from the Vienna specimen, but were unable to obtain usable DNA from the Liverpool specimen. They suggested that the white swamphen may have descended from a few migrant Philippine swamphens during the late Pleistocene (about 500,000 years ago), dispersing over other islands. This indicates a complex history, since their lineages are not recorded on the islands between them; according to the biologists, such results (based on ancient DNA sources) should be treated with caution. Although many purple swamphen taxa had been considered subspecies of the species P. porphyrio, they considered this a paraphyletic (unnatural) grouping since they found different species to group among the subspecies.


The ornithologists Hein van Grouw and Julian P. Hume concluded in 2016 that many of the old accounts had errors in the bird's provenance, that it was endemic to Lord Howe Island, and suggested when the specimens were collected (between March and May 1788) and under which circumstances they arrived in England. They concluded that the white swamphen was a valid species which changed colouration with age, after reconstructing the colouration of juvenile birds before turning white (which was distinct from other swamphens). Van Grouw and Hume found the white swamphen anatomically more similar to the Australasian swamphen than the Philippine swamphen, and suggested that studies with more-complete data sets than the earlier DNA might yield different results. Due to their anatomical similarities, geographic proximity and the recolonisation of Lord Howe and Norfolk Island by Australasian swamphens, they found it likely that the white swamphen was descended from Australasian swamphens.


In 2021, Hume and colleagues reported the results of their palaeontological reconnaissance of Lord Howe Island, which included the discovery of subfossil white swamphen bones. A complete pelvis and representatives of most limb bones were found in the dunes of Blinky Beach (situated at the end of an airport runway), and the authors stated these would provide new insight into the morphology and behaviour of the species.


The length of the white swamphen has been given as 36Â cm (14Â in) and 55Â cm (22Â in), making it similar to the Australasian swamphen in size. Its wings were proportionally the shortest of all swamphens. The wing of the Vienna specimen is 218Â mm (9Â in) mm long, the tail is 73.3Â mm (3Â in), the culmen with its frontal shield (the fleshy plate on the head) is 79Â mm (3Â in), the tarsus is 86Â mm (3Â in), and the middle toe is 77.7Â mm (3Â in) long. The wing of the Liverpool specimen is 235Â mm (9Â in) long, the tarsus is 88.4Â mm (3Â in) and the middle toe is 66.5Â mm (3Â in). Its tail and beak are damaged, and cannot be reliably measured. The white swamphen differed from most other swamphens (except the Australasian swamphen) in having a short middle toe; it is the same length as the tarsus, or longer, in other species. The white swamphen's tail was also the shortest. Both specimens have a claw (or spur) on their wings; it is longer and more discernible in the Vienna specimen, and sharp and buried in the feathers of the Liverpool specimen. This feature is variable among other kinds of swamphen. The softness of the rectrices (tail feathers) and the lengths of the secondary and wing covert feathers relative to the primary feathers appear to have been intermediate between those of the purple swamphen and the takahÄ.


Although the known skins are mostly white, contemporary illustrations depict some blue individuals; others had a mixture of white and blue feathers. Their legs were red or yellow, but the latter colour may be present only on dried specimens. The bill and frontal shield were red, and the iris was red or brown. According to notes written on an illustration by an unknown artist (in the collection of the artist Thomas Watling, inaccurately dated 1792), the chicks were black and became bluish-grey and then white as they matured. The Vienna specimen is pure white, but the Liverpool specimen has yellowish reflections on its neck and breast, blackish-blue feathers speckled on the head (concentrated near the upper surface of the shield) and neck, blue feathers on the breast, and purplish-blue feathers on the shoulders, back, scapular and lesser covert feathers. Some of the rectrices (tail feathers) are purplish-brown, and some of the scapular feathers and those on the mid-back are sooty-brown at the base and sooty-blue further up. The central rectrices are sooty-brown and bluish. This colouration indicates that the Liverpool specimen was a younger bird than the Vienna specimen, and the latter had reached the final stage of maturity. Since the Liverpool specimen preserves some of its original colour, van Grouw and Hume were able to reconstruct its natural colouration before becoming white. It differed from other swamphens in having blackish-blue lores, forehead, crown, nape and hind neck, purple-blue mantle, back, and wings, a darker rump and upper-tail covert feathers, and dark greyish-blue underparts.


Phillip gave a detailed description in 1789, possibly based on a live bird he received in Sydney:


This beautiful bird greatly resembles the purple Gallinule in shape and make, but is much superior in size, being as large as a dunghill fowl. The length from the end of the bill to that of the claws is two feet three inches; the bill is very stout, and the colour of it, the whole top of the head, and the irides red; the sides of the head around the eyes are reddish, very thinly sprinkled with white feathers; the whole of the plumage without exception is white. The legs the colour of the bill. This species is pretty common on Lord Howeâs Island, Norfolk Island, and other places, and is a very tame species. The other sex, supposed to be the male, is said to have some blue on the wings.

The Vienna specimen is today a study skin with its legs outstretched (not a taxidermy mount), but van Grouw and Hume suggested that Stone's 1790 illustration showed its original mounted pose. It is in good condition; although the legs are faded to a pale orange-brown, they were probably reddish in the living bird. It has no yellowish or purple feathers, contradicting Rothschild's observation. Forbes suggested that the Liverpool specimen was ""remade"" and mounted after Stone's illustration, though its present pose is dissimilar. Keuleman's illustration of the mount shows the present pose, so Forbes was either incorrect or a new pose was based on Keuleman's image. The Liverpool specimen is in good condition, although it has lost some feathers from its head and neck. The bill is broken, and its rhamphotheca (the keratinous covering of the bill) is missing; the underlying bone was painted red to simulate an undamaged bill, which has caused some confusion. The legs have also been painted red, and there is no indication of their original colouration. The reason only white specimens are known today may be collecting bias; unusually-coloured specimens are more likely to be collected than normally-coloured ones.


The white swamphen inhabited wooded lowland areas in wetlands. Nothing was recorded about its social and reproductive behaviour and its nest, eggs and call were never described. Presumably it did not migrate. Blackburn's 1788 account is the only one that mentions the diet of this bird:


 ...Â On the shore we caught several sorts of birdsÂ ... and a white fowl â something like a Guinea hen, with a very strong thick & sharp pointed bill of a red colour â stout legs and claws â I believe they are carnivorous they hold their food between the thumb or hind claw & the bottom of the foot & lift it to the mouth without stopping so much as a parrot.

Some contemporary accounts indicated that the bird was flightless. Rowley considered the Liverpool specimen (representing the separate species P. stanleyi) capable of flight, due to its longer wings; Rothschild believed that both were flightless, although he was inconsistent about whether their wings were the same length. Van Grouw and Hume found that both specimens showed evidence of an increased terrestrial lifestyle (including decreased wing length, more robust feet and short toes), and were in the process of becoming flightless. Although it may still have been capable of flight, it was behaviourally flightless, similar to other island birds, such as some parrots. Though the white swamphen was similar in size to the Australasian swamphen, it had proportionally shorter wings and therefore a higher wing load â perhaps the highest of all swamphens. Upon the discovery of subfossil pelvic and limb bones in 2021, Hume and colleagues preliminarily stated that these bones were much more robust in the white swamphen than in the volant Australasian swamphen, a trait common in flightless rails.


Van Grouw and Hume pointed out that a white colour aberration in birds is rarely caused by albinism (which is less common than formerly believed), but by leucism or progressive greying â a phenomenon van Grouw described in 2012 and 2013. These conditions produce white feathers due to the absence of cells which produce the pigment melanin. Leucism is inherited, and the white feathering is present in juveniles and does not change with age; progressive greying causes normally-coloured juveniles to lose pigment-producing cells with age, and they become white as they moult. Since contemporary accounts indicate that the white swamphen turned from black to bluish-grey and then white, Van Grouw and Hume concluded that it underwent inheritable progressive greying. Progressive greying is a common cause of white feathers in many types of birds (including rails), although such specimens have sometimes been inaccurately referred to as albinos. The condition does not affect carotenoid pigments (red and yellow), and the bill and legs of the white swamphens retained their colouration. The large number of white individuals on Lord Howe Island may be due to its small founding population, which would have facilitated the spread of inheritable progressive greying.


Although the white swamphen was considered common during the late 18th century, it appears to have disappeared quickly; the period from the island's discovery to the last mention of living birds is only two years (1788â90). It had probably vanished by 1834, when Lord Howe Island was first settled, or during the following decade. Whalers and sealers had used the island for supplies, and may have hunted the bird to extinction. Habitat destruction probably did not play a role, and animal predators (such as rats and cats) arrived later. Several contemporary accounts stress the ease with which the island's birds were hunted, and the large number which could be taken to provision ships. In 1789, White described how the white swamphen could be caught:


They [sailors] also found on it, in great plenty, a kind of fowl, resembling much of the Guinea fowl in shape and size, but widely different in colour; they being in general all white, with a red fleshy substance rising, like a cockâs comb, from the head, and not unlike a piece of sealing-wax. These not being birds of flight, nor in the least wild, the sailors availing themselves of their gentleness and inability to take wing from their pursuits, easily struck them down with sticks.

The fact that they could be killed with sticks may have been due to their poor flying ability, which would have made them vulnerable to human predation. With no natural enemies on the island, they were tame and curious. The physician John Foulis, who conducted a mid-1840s ornithological survey on the island, did not mention the bird, so it must have been extinct by that time. In 1909, the writer Arthur Francis Basset Hull expressed a hope that the bird still survived in unexplored mountains.


Eight types of bird have become extinct due to human interference since Lord Howe Island was discovered, including the Lord Howe pigeon (Columba vitiensis godmanae), the Lord Howe parakeet (Cyanoramphus subflavescens), the Lord Howe gerygone (Gerygone insularis), the Lord Howe fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa cervina), the Lord Howe thrush (Turdus poliocephalus vinitinctus), the robust white-eye (Zosterops strenuus) and the Lord Howe starling (Aplonis fusca hulliana). The extinction of so many native birds is similar to extinctions on several other islands, such as the Mascarenes.",13,17 March 2004, 31 August 2021,179,1,1

He previously served as Governor of Buenos Aires Province, from 2002 to 2007, and as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship under President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, from 2019 to 2021.


SolÃ¡ was also Secretary of Agriculture during the presidency of Carlos Menem, and served as Vice Governor of Buenos Aires under Carlos Ruckauf until Ruckauf's resignation in 2002. From 2007 to 2019, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies.


Felipe SolÃ¡ was born in Buenos Aires and raised in the upscale Recoleta neighborhood. SolÃ¡ graduated from the University of Buenos Aires as an agricultural engineer in 1981.


Upon graduation SolÃ¡ worked as a university professor, journalist, and economics counselor and researcher. He married MarÃ­a Teresa GonzÃ¡lez in 1982, and they had two children; the couple were separated in 2003. He met MarÃ­a Elena ChÃ¡ves in La Plata in 2004, and the two have lived in his home in Pilar since 2007.


SolÃ¡ was appointed Minister of Agricultural Affairs by Buenos Aires Province Governor Antonio Cafiero in 1987. Newly-elected President Carlos Menem named him Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock and Fishing in 1989, and in 1991 he was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for Buenos Aires Province on the Justicialist Party ticket.


SolÃ¡ returned to the post of Secretary of Agriculture under Menem in 1993, remaining in the post until 1998. His tenure is best known for his controversial 1996 decision to allow the cultivation of GMO soy in Argentina, authorized a mere 81 days after Monsanto applied for a permit.


On 10 December 1999, he became Vice Governor of Buenos Aires under Carlos Ruckauf, and took up the governorship on 3 January 2002, when Ruckauf resigned to become Foreign Affairs Minister for interim President Eduardo Duhalde after the socioeconomic collapse of 2001.


SolÃ¡ abandoned his political allegiance to Duhalde after President NÃ©stor Kirchner did likewise, aligning with Kirchner's expansionist policies. As governor and amid 9% economic growth, his support for Kirchnerist candidates in his province during the campaign for the 2005 legislative elections helped result for a landslide win over Duhalde's faction and other parties. He successfully headed Kirchner's Front for Victory party list for his province's congressional candidates in 2007, stepped down as governor and returned to Congress.


Having been rejected as running mate for 2007 Front for Victory presidential nominee Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, SolÃ¡ became estranged from Kirchnerism during the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector and left their caucus to become a dissident Peronist. Ahead of the 2009 mid-term elections, he joined Francisco de NarvÃ¡ez and Mauricio Macri in UniÃ³n PRO, a center-right coalition of fellow dissident Peronists and the Republican Proposal (PRO) party.


SolÃ¡ became a primary candidate in August 2009 for president ahead of the 2011 elections; but lacking support, he withdrew on 11 June and endorsed Duhalde's Popular Union ticket, which went on to fifth place.


He later joined the Renewal Front, a centrist Peronist faction created by Sergio Massa ahead of the 2013 mid-term elections. Like SolÃ¡, Massa had broken with President Cristina Kirchner after the 2008 agro-export tax hike dispute, and the Renewal Front bested Kirchner's Front for Victory in Buenos Aires Province in 2013.


SolÃ¡ ran for Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 2015 on the Renewal Front-led United for a New Alternative ticket; but placed third (21%). He then headed Massa's Buenos Aires Province party list for the 2017 mid-term elections, dubbed 1PaÃ­s, but again placed third (11%).


He broke with the Renewal Front and on 22 October 2018, joined four fellow Renewal Front congressmen and four allies to create Red por Argentina (RxA; ""Network for Argentina""). Amid a worsening economic crisis SolÃ¡ stated that his goal was to promote unity against the Mauricio Macri administration for the 2019 elections. The member parties of Red por Argentina would later join the broader Frente de Todos coalition.


On 6 December 2019, it was announced SolÃ¡ would be the next Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship of Argentina in the incoming cabinet of President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez. He assumed office alongside the rest of the cabinet on 10 December 2019. 


SolÃ¡ was replaced by Cabinet Chief Santiago Cafiero on 20 September 2021 as part of a cabinet reshuffle, following the government's poor showings in the 2021 legislative primary elections",1,2 September 2005, 20 September 2021,95,5,4

Ommatoiulus is a genus of millipedes in the family Julidae.


The taxonomy of the genus has had a complicated history. As it stands now, there are approximately 60 described species, but this is likely to change. At least 10 new species were described in 2012, and those just from Spain. Six new species were described from Portugal in 2017. There are many millipedes known to belong to this genus that do not yet have official names.


This genus is distinguished by the position of the ozopores, the shape of the ocelli and the gonopod legs, the presence of accessory claws on the juveniles, and the presence in males of a large fovea, a cavity where sperm are stored.


Familiar species include the black Portuguese millipede (Ommatoiulus moreletii). It is an invasive species in Australia known for its ""plagues"", when it emerges in swarms so massive that they stop trains, which crush them in huge numbers and make the rails slippery. Like some other millipedes, it produces a secretion with an obnoxious odor and tendency to stain floors when the swarms invade houses. Another well-known species is the striped millipede (O. sabulosus), which also swarms. In 2002 it flooded the streets of DÄbrowa GÃ³rnicza in Poland, ""causing panic among the inhabitants"". Swarms in France have consisted of ""thousands of millions"" of individuals, far too many to count. This species has also been known to stop trains.

43687952,Jordan Morris,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Morris,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jordan_Morris&action=info,"Jordan Perry Morris (born October 26, 1994) is an American professional soccer player who plays for Seattle Sounders FC as a winger or forward. He also plays for the United States national team. He grew up on Mercer Island, Washington and joined the Sounders youth academy before playing college soccer at Stanford University.


Morris won the Hermann Trophy in his senior season at Stanford and was called up to the United States national team, scoring in a friendly against Mexico. He signed for Seattle's senior team in 2016 as a Homegrown Player.


Morris, from Mercer Island, Washington, began his youth career with Eastside FC, where he played from 2004 to 2012, from U11 to U17, with the Eastside FC B94 Red team, coached by Dan Strom, and helped the team to six of its seven Washington State titles as well as two third-place finishes at the US Youth Soccer National Championships in 2011 and 2012: he was named to the Best XI in 2011, and was the Golden Ball winner in 2012. Morris was also named NSCAA Washington State Player of the Year and NSCAA High School All-American in 2012.


He joined the Sounders FC youth academy and played in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy for one season.


On February 6, 2012, Morris signed a letter of intent to play college soccer at Stanford University.


In his freshman year with the Cardinal, Morris appeared in all 21 matches and led all Pac-12 freshman with seven assists and 19 points and tied for the lead with six goals and helped lead his team to their first NCAA Tournament since 2009 where they would eventually fall 1â0 to #2 seed Washington in the Round of 16. He went on to be named first team All-Pac-12 that year. Morris also spent time with Seattle Sounders FC U-23 in the Premier Development League. In his sophomore year, Morris helped lead Stanford to its first Pac-12 championship since 2001.


In his junior year, Morris scored 13 goals and had 3 assists. He led the Cardinal to both the Pac-12 and the NCAA Championships. In the NCAA tournament, Morris scored 5 of Stanford's total of 12 goals. In the championship game against Clemson, Morris scored his first of two goals in the game only 87 seconds into the contest. On January 8, 2016, Morris was awarded the Hermann Trophy as the best player in NCAA Division I soccer.


In January 2016, Morris trained with German club Werder Bremen at their winter camp, which Bremen chief executive Thomas Eichin described as ""an opportunity for us to get to know the player better."" Later in January, Bremen extended Morris' trial who then played in a friendly match against Inter Baku PIK and recorded an assist. Bremen offered a contract to Morris and Eichin expressed confidence that they would sign him, but Morris turned down the German club's offer in favor of returning to play in the United States. 


After winning the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship, there was speculation that Morris would begin to play professionally. Coach JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann stated that Morris ""obviously has to"" turn pro. On January 5, 2016, Morris announced he decided to forgo his senior season at Stanford to turn pro. It was widely speculated that Morris would sign with the Sounders, the club for which his father works, and also holds his amateur rights. On January 21, 2016, Morris signed with Seattle Sounders FC, being given MLS's highest-ever Homegrown Player contract worth roughly $250,000 a year. He joined the Sounders' preseason training camp in Arizona, debuting in a friendly against Celaya F.C. on February 9, 2016. On February 23, 2016, Morris made his professional debut against Club AmÃ©rica in the CONCACAF Champions League, starting the match. The following week, he debuted in the Sounders' first Major League Soccer game of the season against Sporting Kansas City.


Morris scored his first Major League Soccer goal for the Sounders on April 16, 2016, against the Philadelphia Union. He then went on to score in his next three consecutive games, matching the Seattle rookie scoring record, his next goal then surpassed the rookie goalscoring record which had been set by Steve Zakuani in 2009. He has since helped his team to win the MLS Cup after a run from ninth place into fourth, along with the help of Nicolas Lodeiro, a new midseason acquisition made by Seattle.


On February 22, 2018 while playing in El Salvador against Santa Tecla in the Sounders' first match of the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League, Morris collapsed untouched in the 85th minute with a torn ACL. He was reported to likely miss 6â9 months. After missing the entirety of the 2018 MLS season, Morris was signed to a five-year contract extension with the Sounders in December 2018.


Morris returned for the 2019 season and scored 10 goals during the regular season and a hat-trick in the playoffs to help the Sounders win a second MLS Cup title. He was named MLS Comeback Player of the Year for his recovery.


On January 22, 2021, Swansea City announced that they had signed Morris on a loan for the remainder of the 2020â21 EFL Championship season. He made his debut on January 30 as a substitute against Rotherham United. During a match against Huddersfield Town on February 20, Morris suffered an ACL injury to his left knee and was stretchered off in the 66th minute. The injury forced him to miss the rest of the Swansea City season as well as national team fixtures. As a result, his loan stint was prematurely terminated.


In May 2013, Morris was one of 22 players named to the U.S. under-20 squad for the Toulon Tournament where he made three appearances. He also made appearances for the U.S. under-23 national team on August 6, 2014 and scored in a 5â1 win over Barbados.


On August 28, 2014, Morris received his first senior call up to the U.S. men's national team for a friendly against the Czech Republic, making him the first college player to be called into squad since Chris Albright was called up in 1999 while he was still playing at the University of Virginia. Although he was left on the bench for that match, he made his international debut in November in a 4â1 defeat to Ireland.


On April 15, 2015, he scored his first U.S. men's national team goal against Mexico in an international friendly. In the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final, Morris scored the winning goal for the United States, assuring a victory over Jamaica and becoming joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals.


Morris was born in Seattle, Washington, to Michael and Leslie Morris. His father, Dr. Michael Morris, is the chief medical director of Seattle Sounders FC. He has three siblings named Christopher, Julian and Talia. He attended Mercer Island High School, where he played high school soccer prior to joining the Sounders Academy.


Morris was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of nine and is one of the few professional athletes with the condition to play. He said that having diabetes has helped shape him. His tattoo ""T1D"" on his inner arm is a tribute to the armband people with diabetes have to wear.

He later went on to become a General-lieutenant.


Taran was born on 18 OctoberÂ [O.S. 5 October]Â 1916 to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Sholokhovo in the Yekaterinoslavsky Uyezd of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). After completing seven grades of school he attended a trade school in Zaporizhia, which he graduated from in 1933. He attended another vocational school in 1934, after which he was employed at a Metallurgical plant as an electrician until 1937. That year he graduated from training at the Nikopol aeroclub and joined the military in November. Barely a year later in December 1938 he graduated from the Kacha Military Aviation School of Pilots and was then assigned to the 50th Bomber Aviation Regiment. In Spring 1939 he was transferred to the 35th High-Speed Bomber Regiment, in which he first saw combat during the Soviet invasion of Poland. In November he was deployed to the warfront of the Winter War, where he piloted the Tupolev SB. After returning from the war in April he was assigned to the 81st Long-Range Bomber Regiment as a flight commander.


From the first month of Operation Barbarossa, Taran participated in the defense of the Soviet Union. He soon suffered a close call with death when his Il-4 was shot down by German fighters; he was able to parachute out of the plane shortly before it crashed. All other crew members on board were killed in the crash. Having parachuted out at a low altitude, he landed close to his fallen bomber and buried the remains of his deceased comrades. After returning to his unit three days later he returned to flying and was reassigned to a new flight crew. He remained with that crew until September 1942, during which he flew 150 missions and gained multiple shootdowns of enemy fighters with them. He was again shot down on 24 October 1941. For flying 33 daylight and 26 night missions he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 11 September 1941 and awarded it on 20 June 1942. In August 1942 his unit was honored with the guards designation and renamed the 5th Guards Long-range Aviation Regiment. During the ceremony of receiving the guards flag, Taran was the standard-bearer. That year he received a minor head injury during a mission to bomb an enemy airfield. In September he began flying with a new aircrew, and by 30 November 1943 he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union again for flying 350 sorties, during which two enemy crossings, fifteen supply warehouses, and eight aircraft on the ground were destroyed in addition to starting 39 fires. He was awarded the title again on 13 March 1944 before leaving the 81st Regiment in July.


In July 1944 he became a flight inspector for the 6th Long-range Aviation Corps. In that role he approved nine pilots for night flights and reviewed 76 more pilots. In April he was made commander of the 240th Bomber Aviation Regiment, which carried out 190 sorties during spring 1945 and was tasked with bombing tank columns, ammunition storage facilities, bridges, airfields, and trains as well as photographing bombed areas. Throughout the war he flew 356 sorties, of which 316 were at night. He flew in the battles over Ukraine, the Caucasus, Kuban, Kursk, Leningrad, Belarus, Lviv, the Baltics, Konigsberg and Berlin.


Taran remained in command of the 240th Regiment until April 1946, after which he became a squadron commander in the 199th Guards Bomber Regiment. From March 1948 to May 1951 he served as a flight inspector in the 4th Guards Aviation Corps, which used the B-25 and Tu-4. He then was appointed as commander of the 251st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, which he remained in until being made deputy commander of the 15th Guards Heavy Bomber Division in December 1954; in July 1955 he was promoted to commander of the division, and in 1957 he was promoted to the rank of general-major. After graduating from the Military Academy of the General Staff he became the commander of the 79th Heavy Bomber Division in December 1958; the division used the Tu-95. He then held a variety of flight training and staff posts before retiring in 1979 as a general-lieutenant. From then until 1984 he worked as a designer for the Tupolev Bureau. He died in Moscow on 14 September 2005 and was buried in the Troekurovsky cemetery.

37346986,Henry Heydenryk Jr.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Heydenryk_Jr.,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Heydenryk_Jr.&action=info,"Henry Heydenryk Jr. (1905â1994) was a Dutch American frame maker, historian, author and designer. He was the fourth generation descendant of a family-run business, The House of Heydenryk (Heijdenrijk). Founded in Amsterdam in 1845, the company is one of the worldâs oldest framing companies. The firm made and supplied reproductions and antiques to the Tate and National Gallery museums in England, the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands and for many other important museums and private collectors including Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza and members of the Rothschild family.


In 1936, Henry Heydenryk Jr. brought the firm to New York City in the United States where he would revolutionize the framing industry by creating new designs and finishes. He supplied both hand crafted frames and antiques to major artists, collectors and museums in the US and Europe. He would also author two books on the art and history of picture framing, The Art and History of Frames: An Inquiry into the Enhancement of Paintings in 1963 and The Right Frame: A Consideration of the Right and Wrong Methods of Framing Pictures in 1964.


In the beginning, the American House of Heydenryk was a franchise of the Dutch firm, making period reproductions for artists, galleries and museums. Heydenryk Jr. would eventually branch out from traditional frame making and design his own mouldings and finishes for contemporary artists in Manhattan under the name The House of Heydenryk Jr. Inc.


Henry Heydenryk Jr. is credited with introducing and popularizing the wormy chestnut frame in 1938, using wood from trees destroyed by blight and applying new finishes, painted, scraped and stained, as an alternative to traditional gilt and smooth surfaces.
In 1937, Heydenryk befriended the American Modernist painter Marsden Hartley after his dealer Alfred Stieglitz closed his gallery. He designed and loaned frames for Hartley's first exhibition with the Hudson Walker gallery in 1938. The show was an immediate success and Hartley would continue to use Heydenrykâs designs for all of his exhibits until his death in 1943.


In addition to Hartley, The House of Heydenryk Jr. worked directly with and made frames for other American Modernist artists including Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, Max Weber, Charles Sheeler, Jacob Lawrence, Stuart Davis, Romare Bearden, Milton Avery, Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Abraham Walkowitz.


Heydenryk also produced and sold frames directly to such American painters as Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, John Sloan, Norman Rockwell, Raphael Soyer, Moses Soyer and John Carlton Atherton. He framed the early exhibitions of such Abstract Expressionists as Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and William Baziotes.


Heydenrykâs influence was not limited to American artists. He framed works by Pablo Picasso for the New York galleries of European art dealers Paul Rosenberg, Klaus Perls and Pierre Matisse as well as Picassoâs American art dealer/agent, Samuel Kootz. In 1947, the first post war exhibition of Picassoâs work in the US was presented in Heydenryk frames.


Henry Heydenryk Jr. had a long relationship with the Spanish Surrealist Salvador DalÃ­ from the 1940s through the 1960s. In collaboration with DalÃ­ and the Argentine jeweler Carlos Alemany, Heydenryk created frames for a traveling exhibition of DalÃ­- designed jewels sponsored by the Owen Cheatham Foundation.


Other painters who framed directly with Heydenryk include Fernand LÃ©ger, Yaacov Agam, Moise Kisling, David Burliuk, Reuven Rubin, Philip Evergood and Joseph Solman as well as the portrait photographers Yousuf Karsh and Richard Avedon.


The House of Heydenryk supplied both new and period frames to nearly every major US museum including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Frick Collection, Whitney Museum of American Art, Baltimore Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, St. Louis Art Museum, Kimbell Art Museum, Norton Simon Museum, Smithsonian Institution and Cleveland Museum of Art as well as leading auction houses such as Sotheby's and Christie's.


Henry Heydenryk Jr. worked with The Museum Of Modern Artâs co-founder Mary Quinn Sullivan, the director Alfred H. Barr Jr. and the senior curator Dorothy Canning Miller and framed many major paintings in the collection. In the 1970s, he was appointed the official frame consultant to The National Gallery of Art, providing frames for works dating from the early Renaissance to the 20th century.


In the field of architecture and interior design, Heydenryk designed frames for McKim, Mead & White, William Pahlmann, Samuel Marx, Albert Hadley and Sister Parish, working with their firm Parish Hadley on the Kennedy White House project. Such legendary Hollywood icons of style as Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Ginger Rogers and Lauren Bacall all came to Heydenryk for his advice on framing. Katharine Hepburn was a special client and Heydenryk named a frame after her in honor of their long friendship.


In 1963, Heydenryk wrote The Art and History of Frames: An Inquiry into the Enhancement of Paintings, the first mainstream reference book on the subject. Mr. Heydenryk followed this with The Right Frame: A Consideration of the Right and Wrong Methods of Framing Pictures in 1964, which dealt with the aesthetics of choosing the right frame for artwork. He promoted the book by giving extensive lecture tours, appearing at museums across the country and on television programs such as The Today Show.


On June 23, 1994, Henry Heydenryk Jr. died at The Mary Elizabeth Nursing Home in Mystic, Connecticut. The New York Times paid tribute to his many accomplishments and called him ""the concertmaster of his trade.""

2374446,Gladys Pyle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Pyle,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gladys_Pyle&action=info,"Gladys Shields Pyle (October 4, 1890Â â March 14, 1989) was an American politician and the first woman elected to the United States Senate without having previously been appointed to her position; she was also the first female senator to serve as a Republican and the first female senator from South Dakota. Further, she was the first female senator from outside the south. (The previous four had come from Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama, respectively.) She was also the first unmarried female senator.


Gladys Shields Pyle was born in Huron, South Dakota on October 4, 1890, the daughter of John L. Pyle and Mamie Shields Pyle, and was the youngest of their four children, three girls and one boy. Her father was a lawyer who served as Attorney General of South Dakota and her mother was a leading suffragist in the state. The family lived in a home John built, remaining there after his death from typhoid fever in 1902.


John and Mamie were instrumental in the establishment of Huron College, which Gladys attended. While a student, Gladys competed in debates alongside her sisters. She graduated in 1911, and moved to Chicago to attend the American Conservatory of Music and the University of Chicago.


Pyle worked in education from 1912 to 1920, After teaching Latin and civics for two years in Huron, she became principal of Wessington's public schools. Gladys, her mother Mamie, and two sisters were very involved in the Women's Suffrage movement and frequently hosted meetings of the local League of Women Voters chapter in their house. Pyle became a lecturer for the league and traveled to Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Ohio to give speeches and make presentations.


In 1922, she ran for a seat in the South Dakota House of Representatives. After failing to gain the nomination through the Beadle County Republicans, Pyle ran in the Independent  ticket primary, which she appeared to lose, but successfully contested the result.  In the general election, she was the leading vote getter for the three at large House seats, and was elected on the Independent ticket, along with two Republicans.  In 1923 she became first woman member of the state House of Representatives. She was reelected in 1924, and served from 1923 to 1927.  In addition to her part-time legislative position, Pyle was also appointed to serve as Deputy Secretary of State of South Dakota.


In 1926, Pyle was the successful Republican nominee for Secretary of State of South Dakota.  She was reelected in 1928, polling more votes than had ever been given any candidate for any office in the state, and served from 1927 to 1931.  In 1930, she was a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor.  She won the primary, garnering nearly a third of the vote. Since no candidate received the 35% required under South Dakota law, the contest moved to the Republican Convention, where the delegates would select the nominee from the five candidates on the primary ballot. Pyle led the fourth, and sixth through eleven ballots, increasing her total votes each ballot, except for a significant loss of votes the eighth ballot as she was closing in on the nomination.  During the 12th ballot, the Convention Chair suspended the roll call and over three hours later, three male candidates threw their support to Warren E Green, who had run last in the primary with about 7.5% of the vote and who won the nomination when the roll call resumed. Pyle quickly conceded defeat without rancor or accusation but did not endorse  the nominee until after the filing period for filing as an independent had ended, but later hinted disappointment when she indicated she would not seek further partisan political office. This evident Convention backroom arrangement to deny Pyle the gubernatorial  nomination seemed singularly related to her sex as she was generally well regarded within her party, had achieved a record setting statewide popular vote for any office since statehood in her last election, and had beaten the two presumed leading candidates in the primary without engaging in retail campaigning, choosing to highlight fidelity to performance of her Secretary of State responsibilities during her primary run.   Absent the Convention intrigue, Pyle seemed on course to be the nominee and may well have been elected in 1930 (The relatively unknown and unremarkable Green won that race with 53% of the vote.), which would have made her the first female Governor of any state elected in her own right 44 years before Ella Grasso achieved that accomplishment in Connecticut in 1974. Nellie Tayloe Ross was designated by the Wyoming Democratic Party to run for the unexpired term of her deceased husband in an election held one month after his death in 1924 but lost when she ran for a full term in the 1926 election. Miriam Ferguson (of ""Elect Ma and Get Pa Too"" fame) ran for governor of Texas in 1924 at the behest of her husband, who had been impeached, removed from the governorship, and could not run for state office again, and won.  It was clear during the campaign and her elected term that she was merely his surrogate.  Pyle was executive officer for the State Securities Commission from 1931 to 1933.


While pursuing her political career, Pyle also became active in the life insurance business, and worked as an agent for several companies, including New York Life Insurance Company and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance.  In addition, she was elected president of the Huron Life Underwriters Association, and was active in the National Association of Life Underwriters.


On November 8, 1938, she was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate, winning over 58% of the vote and receiving about 8,500 more votes than the second highest statewide election winner. Pyle received the highest percentage of the vote for non-incumbent Republican nominees and second highest percentage of the vote for all Republican nominees for the U. S. Senate in the 1938 elections.  Pyle was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Peter Norbeck. Norbeck died in December 1936, which allowed the governor of South Dakota to appoint a replacement, and he appointed Democrat Herbert E. Hitchcock.  Hitchcock lost the primary for the Democratic nomination for a full term, and the general election was won by Republican Chan Gurney.  Because he lost the Democratic nomination, a quirk in South Dakota law required Hitchcock to step down following the November 1938 election, which would have created a vacancy before Gurney's term began in January 1939. To fill the two month vacancy, South Dakota Republicans successfully pushed for a special election because of rumors that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would call a special session of Congress to be held before January. State law also prevented Gurney from appearing on the ballot twice, so he was unable to run in the special election.


As a result of these circumstances and the quirks in the law, the Republican Party prevailed upon Pyle, despite her pledge not seek any further partisan political office,  to run in the special election, in part because of her popularity in the state, and in part because she had the name recognition that they would not have to devote many resources to the special election campaign. She campaigned against the New Deal, arguing the program had not gone far enough to help the people of South Dakota.  On the same day that Gurney won election to a full term, Pyle easily defeated Democrat J. T. McCullen Sr. for the short one, running about 6 percentage points ahead of the winning percentage of the next highest statewide office election winner. Pyle was paid for her Senate service and allowed to hire staff, but the Congress was not in session and she was never sworn in.


After the election, Pyle traveled to Washington, D.C. at her own expense, accompanied by her mother and one aide.  No special session was called, so Pyle did not have the opportunity to perform any official Senate duties before her term ended.  She shared a Senate office with Thomas M. Storke, an appointed interim senator from California, and spent her time in Washington lobbying federal agencies including the Works Progress Administration and Bureau of Indian Affairs for approval of projects in South Dakota.


In January 1939, Pyle returned to her insurance business, and remained closely involved in public service work.  In 1940, she became the first woman to deliver a presidential nominating speech at a national convention, speaking on behalf of candidate Harland J. Bushfield.


In addition to resuming her career in the life insurance business, Pyle was the guardian for two orphaned boys and managed her family's 640-acre farm near Huron.  She was a member of the South Dakota Board of Charities and Corrections from 1943 to 1957.


In 1988, Pyle became the oldest living current or former U.S. senator. She died in Huron on March 14, 1989, aged 98. Her ashes are interred at Riverside Cemetery in Huron.


The Pyle House, the family home that Gladys Pyle lived in from 1894 until 1985 is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been converted into a museum. Pyle recorded her own recollections of the home before her death, in preparation for its conversion. It is largely unchanged from when it was built and has many of the original furnishings and interior decorations.",1,4 August 2005, 9 September 2021,222,1,1

1930796,James W. Robinson Jr.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Robinson_Jr.,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_W._Robinson_Jr.&action=info,"James William ""Jim"" Robinson Jr. (August 30, 1940 â April 11, 1966)  was an American soldier and a posthumous recipient of the Medal of Honor. Robinson earned the award while serving with the U.S. Army in Vietnam.  He was a Sergeant (E-5) in the infantry when he was killed under heroic circumstances on April 11, 1966, at age 25.


Born in 1940 in Hinsdale, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, Robinson graduated from Morton High School in 1958 and enlisted in the U.S. Marines, serving primarily in Okinawa. After his service ended in 1961, Robinson worked in the private sector in Northern Virginia, then re-enlisted in 1964, this time in the U.S. Army. Assigned to duty in Panama, Robinson relentlessly requested a transfer to Southeast Asia, which was finally granted in 1965.


Robinson is listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on panel 06E, row 102, and is buried at the Clarendon Hills Cemetery in Darien, Illinois. He was the first Virginia resident to receive the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War.


Robinson Secondary School, opened in 1971 in Northern Virginia's Fairfax County, is named in his honor, as is Robinson Elementary School in Lyons, Illinois. Formerly Elm Elementary, it was renamed in 1967.


Robinson's Medal of Honor was donated to Robinson Secondary School by his father.  The medal is displayed in the school's main hall and has served as an inspiration to the school's student population for many years.


Citation:


For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Company C was engaged in fierce combat with a Viet Cong battalion. Despite the heavy fire, Sgt. Robinson moved among the men of his fire team, instructing and inspiring them, and placing them in advantageous positions. Enemy snipers located in nearby trees were inflicting heavy casualties on forward elements of Sgt. Robinson's unit. Upon locating the enemy sniper whose fire was taking the heaviest toll, he took a grenade launcher and eliminated the sniper.


Seeing a medic hit while administering aid to a wounded sergeant in front of his position and aware that now the 2 wounded men were at the mercy of the enemy, he charged through a withering hail of fire and dragged his comrades to safety, where he rendered first aid and saved their lives. As the battle continued and casualties mounted, Sgt. Robinson moved about under intense fire to collect from the wounded their weapons and ammunition and redistribute them to able-bodied soldiers. Adding his fire to that of his men, he assisted in eliminating a major enemy threat.


Seeing another wounded comrade in front of his position, Sgt. Robinson again defied the enemy's fire to effect a rescue. In so doing he was himself wounded in the shoulder and leg. Despite his painful wounds, he dragged the soldier to shelter and saved his life by administering first aid. While patching his own wounds, he spotted an enemy machine gun which had inflicted a number of casualties on the American force. His rifle ammunition expended, he seized 2 grenades and, in an act of unsurpassed heroism, charged toward the entrenched enemy weapon. Hit again in the leg, this time with a tracer round which set fire to his clothing, Sgt. Robinson ripped the burning clothing from his body and staggered indomitably through the enemy fire, now concentrated solely on him, to within grenade range of the enemy machine gun position. Sustaining 2 additional chest wounds, he marshaled his fleeting physical strength and hurled the 2 grenades, thus destroying the enemy gun position, as he fell dead upon the battlefield.



His magnificent display of leadership and bravery saved several lives and inspired his soldiers to defeat the numerically superior enemy force. Sgt. Robinson's conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity, at the cost of his life, are in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon the 1st Infantry Division and the U.S. Armed Forces.",12,23 May 2005, 15 September 2021,137,3,1
28121069,Redmarshall railway station,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmarshall_railway_station,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redmarshall_railway_station&action=info,"Redmarshall railway station was a railway station on the North Eastern Railway, in County Durham.


The station was opened with a section of the Clarence Railway main line in January 1836. Originally named Carlton, the station was situated between Norton-on-Tees and Stillington. When completed, the main line ran between Haverton Hill and Simpasture, where it joined the Stockton and Darlington Railway. After a series of leases and absorptions, the Clarence Railway eventually became part of the North Eastern Railway (NER) upon the formation of the latter in 1854.


In 1915 the line between Shildon and Newport was electrified. On completion of the work, there were four tracks between Stillington Junction and Carlton West Junction; the southern pair carried the freight trains and were electrified, whilst the northern pair carried the passenger trains and remained steam-worked. At Carlton station, the platforms were only on the northern pair of tracks.


On 1 January 1923 the NER amalgamated with other companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). On 1 July 1923 the LNER renamed the station Redmarshall.


The station was closed by British Railways on 31 March 1952, when passenger trains over the route between Middlesbrough and Ferryhill were withdrawn.  The line is still in use for freight and occasional diverted passenger trains, but no trace of the station itself remains.

41932,Accuracy and precision,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Accuracy_and_precision&action=info,"In a set of measurements, accuracy is closeness of the measurements to a specific value, while precision is the closeness of the measurements to each other.


Accuracy has two definitions:


Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability.


In simpler terms, given a set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the set can be said to be accurate if their average is close to the true value of the quantity being measured, while the set can be said to be precise if the values are close to each other.  In the first, more common definition of ""accuracy"" above, the two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither.


In the fields of science and engineering, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value. The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results.  Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.


The field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms bias and variability instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.


A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment.  Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.


A measurement system is considered valid if it is both accurate and precise. Related terms include bias (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and error (random variability).


The terminology is also applied to indirect measurementsâthat is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.


In addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.


In numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.


In military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (justesse de tir), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target.


In industrial instrumentation, accuracy is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.


Ideally a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value. The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard. Such standards are defined in the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from French: SystÃ¨me international d'unitÃ©s) and maintained by national standards organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.


This also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged. In that case, the term standard error is properly applied: the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged. Further, the central limit theorem shows that the probability distribution of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements.


With regard to accuracy we can distinguish:


A common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and/or precision implicitly by means of significant figures. Where not explicitly stated, the margin of error is understood to be one-half the value of the last significant place. For instance, a recording of 843.6Â m, or 843.0Â m, or 800.0Â m would imply a margin of 0.05Â m (the last significant place is the tenths place), while a recording of 843Â m would imply a margin of error of 0.5Â m (the last significant digits are the units).


A reading of 8,000Â m, with trailing zeros and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeros may or may not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0Â ÃÂ 103Â m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50Â m) while 8.000Â ÃÂ 103Â m indicates that all three zeros are significant, giving a margin of 0.5Â m. Similarly, one can use a multiple of the basic measurement unit: 8.0Â km is equivalent to 8.0Â ÃÂ 103Â m. It indicates a margin of 0.05Â km (50Â m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it. For example, a source reporting a number like 153,753 with precision +/- 5,000 looks like it has precision +/- 0.5. Under the convention it would have been rounded to 154,000.


Alternatively, in a scientific context, if it is desired to indicate the margin of error with more precision, one can use a notation such as 7.54398(23) Ã 10â10 m, meaning a range of between 7.54375 and 7.54421 Ã 10â10 m.


Precision includes:


In engineering, precision is often taken as three times Standard Deviation of measurements taken, representing the range that 99.73% of measurements can occur within. For example, an ergonomist measuring the human body can be confident that 99.73% of their extracted measurements fall within Â± 0.7Â cm - if using the GRYPHON processing system - or Â± 13Â cm - if using unporcessed data.


A shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the ""BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology"" (VIM), items 2.13 and 2.14.


According to ISO 5725-1, the general term ""accuracy"" is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same measurand, it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case trueness is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value and precision is the closeness of agreement among a set of results.


ISO 5725-1 and VIM also avoid the use of the term ""bias"", previously specified in BS 5497-1, because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering, as in medicine and law.


Low accuracy due to low precision


Low accuracy even with high precision


Accuracy is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. That is, the accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. As such, it compares estimates of pre- and post-test probability. To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the ""Rand accuracy"" or ""Rand index"". It is a parameter of the test.
The formula for quantifying binary accuracy is:


Note that, in this context, the concepts of trueness and precision as defined by ISO 5725-1 are not applicable. One reason is that there is not a single âtrue valueâ of a quantity, but rather two possible true values for every case, while accuracy is an average across all cases and therefore takes into account both values. However, the term precision is used in this context to mean a different metric originating from the field of information retrieval (see below).


In psychometrics and psychophysics, the term accuracy is interchangeably used with validity and constant error. Precision is a synonym for reliability and variable error. The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior. Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques, classically through an internal consistency test like Cronbach's alpha to ensure sets of related questions have related responses, and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population.[citation needed]


In logic simulation, a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a logic simulation model to a transistor circuit simulation model. This is a comparison of differences in precision, not accuracy. Precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality.


Information retrieval systems, such as databases and web search engines, are evaluated by many different metrics, some of which are derived from the confusion matrix, which divides results into true positives (documents correctly retrieved), true negatives (documents correctly not retrieved), false positives (documents incorrectly retrieved), and false negatives (documents incorrectly not retrieved). Commonly used metrics include the notions of precision and recall.  In this context, precision is defined as the fraction of retrieved documents which are relevant to the query (true positives divided by true+false positives), using a set of ground truth relevant results selected by humans.  Recall is defined as the fraction of relevant documents retrieved compared to the total number of relevant documents (true positives divided by true positives+false negatives).  Less commonly, the metric of accuracy is used, is defined as the total number of correct classifications (true positives plus true negatives) divided by the total number of documents.


None of these metrics take into account the ranking of results. Ranking is very important for web search engines because readers seldom go past the first page of results, and there are too many documents on the web to manually classify all of them as to whether they should be included or excluded from a given search.  Adding a cutoff at a particular number of results takes ranking into account to some degree. The measure precision at k, for example, is a measure of precision looking only at the top ten (k=10) search results. More sophisticated metrics, such as discounted cumulative gain, take into account each individual ranking, and are more commonly used where this is important.",19,26 February 2002, 18 August 2021,"1,259",0,0
14831795,The Saint and The Sow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saint_and_The_Sow,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Saint_and_The_Sow&action=info,"The Saint and The Sow (""O Santo e a Porca"", in the original title) is a very popular Brazilian play written by Ariano Suassuna that was first published in 1957. The play, according to Suassuna, is a ""Northeastern imitation"" from the play Aulularia (a.k.a. The Pot's Comedy), from the Roman writer Plautus.


The story focuses in Eurico Ãrabe, who is called EuricÃ£o Engole-Cobra (something like EuricÃ£o Swallows-Snake) by his employees. Eurico is a ""rich"" and niggard man who has a beautiful and courteous daughter called Margarida and two employees: a smart housemaid called Caroba and his ""Official Servant"" DÃ³dÃ³, who is Margarida's secret boyfriend.


One day, a man called PinhÃ£o (who is Caroba's secret boyfriend) arrives in Eurico's house with a letter from the rich and powerful Colonel Eudoro. It was written in the letter:


""My dear and honored Eurico: I expect you have being enjoying your peace and prosperity! Above all, I desire that your charming daughter Margarida be fine and healthy like she was in the days that she spent in my house, if you remember. I sent this letter with my loyal employee PinhÃ£o to advise you of the visit I will make to your home soon and I fear that I will steal your most precious treasure.""


Then, Eurico becomes mad thinking that Eudoro will steal his coffer (that is in the form of a pig - in this case, a sow) and tries to ""stop"" Eudoro's robbery. But Caroba, in a secret meeting with Margarida, PinhÃ£o and DodÃ³, tells them that the ""most precious treasure"" in the letter referred to Margarida and that Eudoro was going to marry her. Then they make a plan to try to reconcile Eudoro with his old love, Benona. But they will have to take care about Eurico, who is trying to protect his ""sow coffer"".


A despite of being part of the title, the saint is not important to the play. In fact, the saint is a statue of Saint Antonio, to whom Eurico prays a lot (usually asking for more money or for protection of his ""sow coffer"").


The play is divided in three acts:


The play is considered, by the Brazilian critics, as being Suassuna's second best play[citation needed], only behind his classic O Auto da Compadecida.

107488,"Calexico, California","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calexico,_California","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calexico,_California&action=info","Calexico (/kÉËlÉksÉªkoÊ/) is a city in southern Imperial County, California. Situated on the Mexican border, it is linked economically with the much larger city of Mexicali, the capital of the Mexican state of Baja California. It is about 122 miles (196Â km) east of San Diego and 62 miles (100Â km) west of Yuma, Arizona. Calexico, along with six other incorporated Imperial County cities, forms part of the larger populated area known as the Imperial Valley.


First explored by Europeans in the 18th century, Calexico began as a small tent community which was ultimately incorporated in 1908.


The name of the city is a portmanteau of California and Mexico. The originally proposed names were Santo Tomas or Thomasville. Mexicali is a similarly named city directly across the international border from Calexico, its name being a portmanteau of the words ""Mexico"" and ""California"".


The expedition of Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza traveled through the area some time between 1775 and 1776, during Spanish rule. The trail through Calexico was designated as a historical route by the State of California.


Calexico began as a tent city of the Imperial Land Company; it was founded in 1899, and incorporated in 1908. The Imperial Land Company converted desert land into a fertile setting for year-round agriculture. The first post office in Calexico opened in 1902.


On April 4, 2010, the El Mayor earthquake caused moderate to heavy damage throughout Calexico and across the border in Mexicali. Measuring 7.2 Mw, the quake was centered about 40 miles (64Â km) south of the U.S.âMexico border near Mexicali. A state of emergency was declared and officials cordoned off First and Second streets between Paulin and Heber Avenues. Glass and debris littered the streets of downtown Calexico and two buildings partially collapsed. The Calexico water treatment plant sustained severe damage.


According to the United States Census Bureau, at the 2010 census, the city had a total area of 6.2 square miles (16Â km2), all land.
Calexico is located 230 miles (370Â km) southeast of Los Angeles, 125 miles (201Â km) east of San Diego, 260 miles (420Â km) west of Phoenix, and adjacent to Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico.


Calexico's location provides easy overnight trucking access to all those transportation hubs plus the ports of Long Beach, California, and Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.


Calexico is served by State Routes 98, 7 and 111, with direct connection to Interstate 8 (5 miles north) and State Route 86. There are eighteen regular and irregular common carriers for intrastate and interstate truck service to Calexico.


Rail service is provided by Union Pacific Railroad, and connects with the main line to Portland, Oregon; Rock Island, Illinois; Tucumcari, New Mexico; St. Louis, Missouri; and New Orleans, Louisiana.


Within city limits is Calexico International Airport, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection check-point for private passenger and air-cargo flights entering the U.S. from Mexico. Private charter services are also available there.


General aviation facilities and scheduled passenger and air-cargo service to San Diego International Airport, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, and other points are available at Imperial County Airport (Boley Field), located 17 miles (27Â km) north.


Calexico has a subtropical hot-desert climate (BWh), according to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system. In December 1932, the city experienced a rare snowfall. Rainfall usually occurs in the winter months of December, January and February. Although summer is extremely dry in Calexico, there are occasional thunderstorms. In 2008, during the months of July and August there were several heavy thunderstorms that let down large amounts of rain and hail.  Summer rainfall in the city is infrequent. During winter time, Calexico is sometimes affected by winter rain showers.


The summer temperatures in Calexico are very hot, with most of those days having temperatures at or above 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C). However, the hot desert climate seen in Calexico is actually not unusual for similar parallels, seen in Baghdad, Iraq for example.


The area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure.


The 2010 United States Census reported that Calexico had a population of 38,572. The population density was 4,596.7 people per square mile (1,774.8/km2). The racial makeup of Calexico was 23,150 (60.0%) White, 134 (0.3%) African American, 204 (0.5%) Native American, 504 (1.3%) Asian, 21 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 12,920 (33.5%) from other races, and 1,639 (4.2%) from two or more races.  Hispanic or Latino of any race were 37,354 persons (96.8%).


The Census reported that 38,472 people (99.7% of the population) lived in households, 100 (0.3%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.

The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.6%; the rental vacancy rate was 3.1%.  22,155 people (57.4% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 16,317 people (42.3%) lived in rental housing units.


The City of Calexico operates under a City Council/City Manager form of government. The City Council consists of five Council Members, elected to overlapping four-year term. The Mayor and Mayor Pro-Tem are chosen from among the five council members and rotate on an annual basis.


The Mayor presides at council meetings, where all official policies and laws of the city are enacted. The members of the Calexico City Council set policy and appoint commissions and committees that study the present and future needs of Calexico.


The other two elected officials in the City of Calexico are the City Clerk and City Treasurer. Each of them is elected directly by the voters and serves a four-year term.


The Calexico branch of the Imperial County Superior Court system was officially renamed on Saturday, December 19, 1992, in honor of Legaspi family members Henry, Victor and Luis Legaspi as the Legaspi Municipal Court Complex.

2379441,USS Neville (APA-9),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Neville_(APA-9),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=USS_Neville_(APA-9)&action=info,"USS Neville (APA-9) was a  Heywood-class attack transport in the United States Navy, named for Wendell Cushing Neville, a general in the United States Marine Corps.


The ship was ordered in 1918 as SS War Harbour and completed at Bethlehem Steel Company's (Union Iron Works into 1917), Alameda, California yard as hull #162A for the British Shipping Controller, London, requisitioned during construction and completed by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as Independence and assigned official number 217172. She was acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 16 November 1918 with Lt. O. P. Rankin in command and made one Atlantic crossing from New York to England with foodstuffs in 1919. After World War I service, she decommissioned on 20 March 1919 and was returned to the USSB for US Merchant Marine service. Rebuilt and renamed City of Norfolk in 1930, she was run by the Baltimore Mail Steamship Company until reacquired by the Navy on 14 December 1940. Converted by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works, Portland, Oregon, she recommissioned as Neville (AP-16), on 14 May 1941, Captain C. A. Bailey in command.


On 18 June 1941, Neville reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet and for the remaining days of quasi-peace in 1941 transported military and naval personnel to various points along the East Coast and in the Caribbean. On 7 December 1941 she was at San Juan, en route from Trinidad to New York. Within the month, however, she was conducting landing exercises with Army units along the Virginia coast. Detached from that duty in mid-February, she embarked Army and Navy personnel and equipment and departed the East Coast, on 19 February 1942, on the first trans-oceanic run of her second world war.


She completed the round-trip voyage to Belfast, including a stop at Glasgow, on 25 March, at New York, disembarked RAF, RCAF, and British Merchant Navy personnel, and then continued on to Norfolk for voyage repairs. At the same time, she received 20Â mm guns and more modern landing craft for use in her new operational territory, the Pacific.


Neville departed Hampton Roads, on 10 April, and steaming south with TFÂ 38, transited the Panama Canal, on the 18th, becoming a unit of TransDiv 8, ServRon 4, Pacific Fleet. Anchoring in Fanui Bay, Bora Bora, on 4 May, she discharged her Army and Seabee passengers and proceeded on to Wellington, New Zealand, where she remained until 22 July. Then, with units of the 1st Marine Division embarked, she headed toward the Fiji Islands to rendezvous with other Allied vessels assigned to ""Operation Watchtower"", the assaults on Tulagi and Guadalcanal.


At 0630, on 7 August, Neville arrived in her assigned transport area off beach ""Blue"" on Tulagi. Seven minutes later she lowered her boats and Raider groups were dispatched. At 0730 Marine Combat Team 2 was debarked into landing boats which put them ashore soon after ""H-hour"", 0800. Despite increasingly stiff opposition, all assigned waves had been landed by 1012. By 1320, aerial resistance, in the form of bombers and fighters, had been added to the well developed Japanese defenses in the Tulagi-Gavutu-Tanambogo area. The long battle for the Solomons had begun.


Neville remained in the area through the 9th, witnessing, from a distance, the devastation wrought off Savo Island on that date. On the 13th, she arrived at NoumÃ©a, New Caledonia, whence she continued on to Wellington to take on reinforcements. Returning to the combat area on 26 October, she participated in the landings at Aola Bay on 4 November, and then departed to take up transport duties in the New Caledonia-New Hebrides area. At the end of the month, she again returned to Guadalcanal, discharged supplies and reinforcements, took on personnel to be evacuated, and headed south east. After stopping at Espiritu Santo to disembark her evacuees, she proceeded to San Diego, arriving on 4 January 1943 for availability.


On 14 February, Neville, now redesignated APA-9 (effective 1 February), stood out from San Diego en route back to the Atlantic. She arrived at Norfolk on 10 March, and after amphibious training in the Chesapeake Bay area, sailed on 8 June for North Africa to prepare for the Sicilian invasion. By 10 July she was off Scoglitti with ""Cent"" Force as it landed Army units on either side of that fishing town. Assigned to the Northern Group, Neville's boats delivered units of the 45th ""Thunderbird"" Division to ""Red"" beach, near the mouth of the Acate River, at 0434. Despite being the last group to get away from their transport, heavy surf, and indefinite landmarks, they were the first to touch down on the beach. With the last wave in by 0640, the task of discharging cargo was begun. On the afternoon of the 12th, the APA departed the assault area and returned to Oran, whence she sailed, on the 22nd, for the United States.


Neville arrived at Newport News, Virginia, 3 August, only to depart again on the 23rd, once more assigned to the Pacific. By the end of September she was engaged in intensive landing exercises in the Hawaiian Islands. On 10 November she stood out of Honolulu and sailed for the Gilberts with troops of the 27th Division and a platoon of Marine Raiders, 5th Amphibious Corps, embarked.


On the morning of 20 November, Marine and Army units were landed on Tarawa and Makin. At 0642 Neville dispatched her Marines to secure Katubam but kept her Army units on board for later landings on the lagoon side of Butaritari. By 1015 the first of eight waves had been dispatched, landing on beach ""Yellow"" at 1040 under an opposing storm of small arms fire. Cargo discharge operations, begun later in the day, continued through the 22nd. On the 23rd, Neville departed the transport area only to return the next day to take on survivors from Liscome BayÂ (CVE-56) before returning to Pearl Harbor. From Pearl Harbor, the transport steamed to Bremerton, Washington, underwent repairs, and then headed south to San Diego, arriving on 31 December.


With the new year, 1944, Neville received new landing craft, fresh boat crews, and orders to join Trans Div 30 at Pearl Harbor. She arrived in Hawaii on 9 January, again took on units of the 27th Division, and on the 23rd got underway, with TGÂ 51.1, the Kwajalein Attack Force Reserve Group. Neville sighted Kwajalein on the 31st, but maneuvered east of the Atoll until entering the lagoon on 2 February. There she engaged in debarkation drills in preparation for the assault on Eniwetok. On 11 February, the uncommitted Kwajalein Reserve Group was dissolved and reformed as the Eniwetok Expeditionary Group. Four days later the group, TGÂ 51.11, sortied from Kwajalein.


On the 17th, Neville entered Eniwetok lagoon and prepared to land her troops on the main objective, Engebi, the following morning. The first waves hit the beaches at 0844. Neville's boats, used on the 17th and on the morning of the 18th, were not called on to transport her own passengers to the beaches until after the vessel had shifted to Transport Area 3. Then, at 1609, troops were debarked for landings on Eniwetok Island. For the next three days, she remained off Eniwetok, sending supplies to the beaches and taking on casualties. On the 23rd, she shifted to the Parry Island transport area, where she remained for four days. APAâ9 then got underway for Kwajalein, Pearl Harbor, and, ultimately, San Francisco. On 8 April, she returned to Hawaii to conduct amphibious training exercises with Marine personnel in preparation for ""Operation Forager"", the push into the Marianas.


Assigned in May to TransDiv 10, Neville departed Honolulu on 30 May, and steamed west with TFÂ 52. Soon after 0630 on 15 June, she was in her assigned transport area, 7 miles (11Â km) off Saipan. By 0700 her boats had departed for a demonstration feint off Mutcho Point, Garapan. Her boats reloaded in mid-morning, she shifted to the Charan Kanoa transport area. At 1103 she received orders to send her troops in to beach ""Green Two"". The first boats shoved off for the departure line at 1135 and by 1340 the job was completed.


From the 15th until the 18th, the transport retired each night to positions just off the islands of Saipan and Tinian. From the 19th to the 21st, as the Battle of the Philippine Sea raged, she cruised 75â100Â miles east-northeast of Saipan, then returned to complete off-loading cargo at Saipan. On the 23rd, she turned her bow toward Eniwetok, where Japanese POWs were taken on board. Next sailing to Kwajalein, she embarked ambulatory casualties, and on 5 July joined a convoy headed for Pearl Harbor. There, on 13 July, she delivered her prisoners, and the next day continued her voyage, arriving at San Diego on the 21st.


On her arrival at San Diego, Neville was assigned to TU 13.1.1, TransDiv 1, then conducting amphibious training exercises for assault troops. From 3 January 1945 until 15 August, she operated as a training ship for APA crews, and then, after the cessation of hostilities, resumed duties as a transport to ferry fresh troops to former Japanese islands in the South Pacific and bring home veterans.


On 15 January 1946, the World War I transport departed California for the last time. Steaming to the East Coast, she arrived at Boston on 5 February to begin inactivation, decommissioning on 30 April. Transferred to War Shipping Administration on 16 July, she was struck from the Navy List on 15 August 1946, and scrapped in 1957.


Neville received 5 battle stars for her World War II service.

66015090,United StatesâYugoslavia relations,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Yugoslavia_relations,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_StatesâYugoslavia_relations&action=info,"United StatesâYugoslavia relations were historical foreign relations between United States and now split-up Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929â1941) or Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945â1992). During the existence of the country relations oscillated from mutual ignorance, antagonism to close cooperation and significant direct American engagement.


The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was created in the aftermath of the World War I under the influence of the Fourteen Points self-determination ideas by President Woodrow Wilson. Prior to Yugoslav unification United States established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Serbia from 1882 and the Principality of Montenegro from 1905. The United States was the first country to diplomatically recognize Yugoslavia.


During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States initially supported the royalist Yugoslav government in exile. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks in the first years of the war. This however changed once British sources recognized Yugoslav Partisans as the only significant resistance movement which will rise to become the most effective anti-Axis resistance movement during the war.


In the initial period after the war relations between the two countries were poor with Yugoslavia being perceived as the closest Soviet ally, and the country in which Communist party gained power without any significant Soviet support. This phase lasted in a short period after the end of the World War II in 1945 and before the beginning of the Cold War in 1947. This period was characterized by Soviet conciliatory diplomacy towards West and much more belligerent Yugoslav foreign policy involved in issues such as the Free Territory of Trieste and Greek Civil War. Relations were further strained when two USAF C-47 Skytrain cargo aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia in the space of two weeks.


The 1948 Tito-Stalin split represented the major turning point in the relations of United States and the new socialist republic. Yugoslavia first requested assistance from the United States in summer 1948. The Truman administration decided to provide substantial aid, loans and military assistance to Yugoslavia despite some concerns caused by earlier relations. Tito received US backing in Yugoslavia's successful 1949 bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, against Soviet opposition. In 1949, the United States provided loans to Yugoslavia, and in 1950 the loans were increased and followed by large grants and military aid. Even though the Yugoslavs initially avoided asking for military aid believing that it would be a pretext for a Soviet invasion, by 1951 Yugoslav authorities became convinced that Soviet attack was inevitable and Yugoslavia was included in the Mutual Defense Assistance program. United States recognized strategic importance of an independent and successful socialist Yugoslavia as an subversive model for other states which were part of the East Bloc.


The Yugoslav diplomacy dealt successfully with the shifts in the focus of American policy from Kennedy's ""Grand Design,"" Johnson's ""building bridges"" appeal, Nixon's personal diplomacy, to Carter's focus on the human rights. Yugoslavia pursued a highly independent foreign policy and maintained leadership of the international Nonaligned movement that created a competing ideology and challenged the two superpowers.

Yugoslav representative Dragoslav PejiÄ talking to George H.W. Bush at the United Nations Security Council meeting on 14 July 1988.


In the initial stage of the Yugoslav crisis and the Breakup of Yugoslavia at the end of the Cold War the United States were strong advocates of Yugoslav integrity. At the same time, Washington believed the crisis was an issue for Europe to resolve. Failure of the European Community and subsequently the European Union to deal with the Yugoslav Wars led to significant American involvement in the region. In this process Presidency of Bill Clinton provided security guarantees and efforts for smaller and weaker former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. This led to some frictions with Croatia and significant one with the Serbia and Montenegro (which US rejected to recognize as the sole successor to Socialist Yugoslavia) and Bosnian Serbs which escalated in 1995 Operation Deliberate Force and 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and lasted all up until the Overthrow of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ.

He met his future wife Pam, daughter of silent film star Percy Marmont, at The Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. They went on to marry in 1955 and had two children, Emma in 1957 and Robin in 1959, both of whom went into the theatre.


Watson made his first appearance on stage while still a student at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art at a matinee performance in memory of Ellen Terry at Hythe, Kent. After appearances in repertory, he appeared on the West End stage, including The Doctor's Dilemma and in The Rivals by Sheridan both at the Haymarket Theatre.


In 1963, he went to New York City to appear in The Private Ear and The Public Eye. He played the part of the Art Editor in the BBC series Compact for some years.


He appeared in several films, including Operation Crossbow and The Grass Is Greener, in which he played opposite Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons.


Watson had a series of television credits to his name, most notably as Brigadier Arthur Maiford, MC (ret.) (but always known to the Larkins as ""The General"") in The Darling Buds of May (1991â1993); and George Frobisher in Rumpole of the Bailey (1978â1992). He also appeared as Sir Robert Muir in the Doctor Who story Black Orchid; and had a small role in Yes Minister. He also appeared in the 1974 version of The Pallisers as Barrington Erle and in the Albert Campion mystery The Case of the Late Pig as the Chief Constable. He also played a Chief constable in the 1977 BBC series Murder Most English and Mr Bennet in the 1980 BBC series Pride and Prejudice.

Years later in the early 2000s he took on Ancestral Voices, based on the diaries of James Lees Milne written by Hugh Massingberd. His final one-man show was written and devised by himself based on his own life as an actor, entitled Looking Back and Dropping Names, which was published in book form in September 2016.

He was ordained to the diaconate and priest in 1881 by his uncle Bishop John W. Beckwith of Georgia. He served as rector of St Luke's Church in Atlanta, Georgia from 1884 til 1886. While rector of this church he was elected Assistant Bishop of Texas, but declined the appointment. Later, in 1886, he became rector of Christ Church in Houston, Texas, and in 1892 became rector of Trinity Church in Galveston, Texas, where he remained till 1902.


Beckwith was elected Bishop of Alabama on October 8, 1902 during a special council which took place in St John's Church in Montgomery, Alabama. He was then consecrated in St Paul's Church in Selma, Alabama on December 17, 1902 by Bishop Thomas Underwood Dudley of Kentucky.  He died in office on April 18, 1928 in Montgomery, Alabama.

12717134,Freshwater bivalve,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_bivalve,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freshwater_bivalve&action=info,"Freshwater bivalves are one kind of freshwater mollusc, along with freshwater snails. They are bivalves which live in freshwater, as opposed to saltwater, the main habitat type for bivalves. 


The majority of species of bivalve molluscs live in the sea, but in addition, a number of different families live in freshwater (and in some cases also in brackish water). These families belong to two different evolutionary lineages (freshwater mussels and freshwater clams), and the two groups are not closely related. Freshwater bivalves have a simple morphology that varies among taxa and are distributed around most regions of the world.


Species in the two groups vary greatly in size. Some of the pea clams (Pisidium species) have an adult size of only 3 mm. In contrast, one of the largest species of freshwater bivalves is the swan mussel, in the family Unionidae; it can grow to a length of 20Â cm, and usually lives in lakes or slow rivers. Freshwater pearl mussels are economically important as a source of freshwater pearls and mother of pearl. While some species are short-lived, others can be quite long-lived with some species registering longevity in the 100s of years 


Freshwater bivalves live in many types of habitat, ranging from small ditches and ponds, to lakes, canals, rivers, and swamps. The ecology of freshwater bivalves varies among species in regards to differences in reproduction and predation. In spite of their variety of  ecosystems, freshwater bivalves are some of the most endangered species on the planet. In North America, many freshwater mussel species have gone extinct, and of those remaining, 65 percent are rated as endangered, threatened or vulnerable. Droughts, forest clearing, farming, some uses of dams for water management, and changes in water temperature can all pose threats. Restoration efforts focus on rebuilding lost mussel populations in the wild, and on using those mussels to improve and protect water quality and restore broader ecosystems.


Freshwater bivalves, as their name implies, are composed of two halves, or a left and right valve, connected via a soft ligament along a hinge. These two valves are non-living, composed of both organic and inorganic substances that make up three major valve layers. The first, outermost layer is the thin epidermis (periostracum), followed by a second prismatic layer, containing calcium carbonate. The third and innermost layer is also the thickest and is most commonly referred to as the mother of pearl--- a widely harvested source for the production of ornamental buttons. The external appearances of these shells can be extremely variable when comparing members of different families, genus, etc., as well as intraspecies. Valve surface appearances can range from smooth to dramatically sculpted, showcasing ornamental pustules, pimples, grooves, and ridges. The overall shape of the valve can also vary drastically, from laterally compressed and narrow, to wide and globular.


The mantle is a multifunctional, generally thin and fragile structure that line bivalve interiors and encloses their bodies. This structure secretes the shell, contains respiratory organs (facilitates respiration), and facilitates feeding. The cavity that exists between the mantle and other soft tissues is aptly named the mantle cavity.


Within the mantle cavity on either side of the foot are the gills. The inner gills are adjacent to the foot and the outer gills nearest to the mantle and shell. As expected, these gills mainly act as a respiratory structure, facilitating gas exchange but can also facilitate in feeding. Water can enter the mantle cavity via an incurrent siphon, and pass over the gills where food and other particles are trapped by secreted mucus.


Anterior and posterior adductor muscles connect the left and right valves, facilitating shell opening and closure. The less major anterior and posterior retractor muscles extend from the shell and attach the body to a structure called the foot. This muscular foot is typical of most bivalves, extending anteriorly between the valves (via an anterior protractor muscle) and aiding in locomotion, digging and anchoring (holdfast).


The exact distribution of every freshwater bivalve genera cannot be ascertained because of the lack of data in certain areas of the world like Africa and South America, but freshwater bivalves have been found in all of Earth's biogeographic realms, except for the Antarctic biogeographic realm. There are 40 freshwater bivalve representative genera in the Palearctic biogeographic realm, 59 in the Nearctic, 23 in the Afrotropical, 51 in the Neotropical, 47 in the Oriental, 13 in the Australasian, and two in the Pacific Ocean Islands, for a total of 206 freshwater bivalve genera currently identified in the world. Freshwater bivalves are native to the Oriental biogeographic realm and to the southeastern United States and have been introduced to other regions, specifically the two genera in the Pacific Ocean Islands were introduced from Hawaii. Â As new methods of identifying and locating freshwater bivalves improve, the distribution of where these freshwater bivalves occur can become more apparent.


The study of freshwater bivalves predates Aristotle and has since been in a state of constant flux and dispute, regarding their identification and classification. As time has progressed, so too have different techniques and technologies that allow scientists to more comprehensively study the assemblages of organisms in the natural world, freshwater bivalves included. Modern genetic analysis has had major applications in the modern history of taxonomy and has been since utilized in the advancement of freshwater bivalve classification by allowing researchers to identify commonly used genes within these groups. The most commonly used method of identification/classification utilizes an exceptionally diverse set of ever-expanding morphological features, ranging from shell anatomy, variations in internal soft tissue, degrees of mantle fusion, to larval stage development.


The Unionida, of worldwide distribution, are the pearly freshwater mussels. All reproduce by means of a larval stage that is parasitic on a fish or salamander.  Many species are utilized as sources of mother-of-pearl.


Families:


Family Margaritiferidae, a shell of Margaritifera auricularia


Family Unionidae, Quadrula metanevra, the monkeyface mussel


Family Unionidae, Anodonta cygnea


The Veneroida is a large group of bivalve ""clams"", most of which are marine. However, several families occur in fresh and brackish waters.



Families: 


Family Corbiculidae, shell of Corbicula fluminea


Family Sphaeriidae, Sphaerium corneum, one of the small fingernail clams.


Family Dreissenidae, Dreissena polymorpha


Freshwater Bivalves can utilize either ovoviviparous or viviparous reproduction strategies, ovoviviparous meaning that embryos develop and grow in eggs inside the female until they are ready to be released. The embryos get nutrition from egg yolk, but are not connected to the mother by a placental connection. Viviparous meaning embryos develop inside the body of a female and usually gain nutrition by a placental connection. Females tend to have a single reproductive spawning period (when the ova moves to the gills) while males tend to have two spawning periods (a release of sperm into the water column). Females have highest ova, or mature female reproductive cells, during September with a gradual decrease until December. Males spawn between September and December with a second spawning period between May and July. Males release their sperm into the water column for females to accept. Females take up the sperm along with water through their circulatory system and have the potential to become fertilized when the sperm meets the ova. In contrast to Marine Bivalves, most female freshwater bivalve species hold the fertilized embryos until they develop into larvae when they are released into the water.


Once larvae are released into the water column they become semi-parasitic and attach to the gills of freshwater fish. They attach to a host where they grow into juvenile adults while doing little to no damage to the fish host. The order Unionidae have an obligate parasitic larval stage where the larvae are attached to the gills, fins or the body of a particular host fish.


Microbial water composition and sediment composition are important in larval nutrition.


Invasive species pose a risk to freshwater bivalve populations. Specifically two invasive species of crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, are predators of the freshwater bivalve species Anodonta anatina. In general, freshwater bivalves have predators such as raccoons, otters, some species of fish, and some species of turtles.


Droughts, floods, and heat waves are a few examples of major climatic events that are happening more frequently because of the global changing climate. This is a huge killer of freshwater bivalve populations. 


Freshwater bivalves are important bioindicators of freshwater ecosystems because they are the connection between the water column and the benthos, for they can provide information on the quality of the water based on the particles and toxins that bioaccumulate in the tissue of bivalves. Freshwater bivalves are filter feeders and provide an ecological service by improving water quality in the bodies of water they inhabit, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Water quality is improved by filtering out fine particles of silt, organic matter, and heavy metals as well as bacteria and phytoplankton in the water column to reduce turbidity.


Freshwater bivalves are also important in the process of nutrient cycling because they deposit organic matter in the sediment through biodeposition created from the fine particles they filter in. Organic matter can be deposited in the sediment as feces or dead matter, and depending on if the right environmental conditions are present, such as hypoxia, sediment denitrification can occur, releasing nitrogen back into the atmosphere. However, other organisms are unable to utilize this inorganic form of nitrogen, so freshwater bivalves can also excrete dissolved nutrients in an accessible form for primary producers and consumers to assimilate. Any nutrients that were retained by the freshwater bivalve through its lifespan for building shell tissue can serve as a long-term nutrient storage in the benthos when the organism dies, depending on water chemistry and flow conditions. Considering freshwater bivalves can filter particles and process nutrients in the nutrient cycle, there are other species of freshwater bivalves that have more specialized ecosystem functions as well as different vulnerabilities.


Dreissenidae are a family of freshwater mollusks considered to be an invasive species found across Eurasia and North America. The most common types of dreissenids are Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra mussel) and Dreissena rostriformis (Quagga mussel). These mussels damage both ecological systems and human infrastructure. In North America, biofouling caused by dreissenids created 267 million dollarsâ worth of damage between 1989 and 2004. When introduced to freshwater ecosystems, dreissenids lead to a decline in indigenous marine animal populations and are also known for causing benthic algae and cyanobacterial blooms. The total impact of dreissenids on freshwater ecosystems is still unknown.


Pollution, human disturbance, invasive species, and ecosystem modification are the main threats to freshwater bivalves. In North America freshwater bivalves are extremely threatened, with 202 of 300 species considered critical, possibly extinct, or extinct. Of the dangers facing freshwater bivalves, eighty-five percent of them are considered to be âongoing threatsâ. Ecosystem modification and pollution are currently the two biggest threats to molluscs and gastropods in Palearctic and Nearctic ecozones. Pollution is the dominant issue for these animals in the Afrotropic and Indomalayan biogeographic realms. For the Neotropics and Australasia biogeographic realms, ecosystem modification has the largest impact on freshwater bivalve species. Hydropower plants and dams are two examples of human ecosystem modification which contributes to loss of habitat as well as changes to channel morphology, river and floodplain connectivity and nutrient limitation. Rates of extinction among freshwater bivalves are higher than those of terrestrial groups which share the same ecosystem. Among those bivalves, freshwater gastropods are the most highly threatened due to smaller species distribution. Freshwater bivalves are at a heightened risk for endangerment and extinction because of the connectivity of river systems. Anthropogenic impacts on rivers spread throughout the whole ecosystem.",6,10 August 2007, 24 July 2021,92,0,0

He is an inventor, businessman, entrepreneur, aviator (pilot), investor, and philanthropist. He led the development of the EMC Symmetrix, the flagship product of EMC Corporation in the 1990s.


Moshe Yanai was born in 1949 in Israel, and earned a B.Sc. in electrical engineering in 1975 from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.
Yanai began his career building IBM-compatible mainframe data storage based on minicomputer disks for Elbit Systems (a joint project with Nixdorf Computer). He went on to develop high-end storage systems for Nixdorf in the United States.


Yanai joined EMC Corporation in 1987, and managed the Symmetrix development, software and hardware, from its inception in the late 1980s until shortly before leaving EMC in 2001. His development team grew from several people, recruited among his former Israeli colleagues, to thousands, while he was vice president. EMC grew in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company with a fading business of (minicomputer) computer memory boards, valued in several millions of dollars, to a hundreds-of-billions company. Before leaving he became an EMC Fellow.


Yanai  funded and led an Israeli storage startup company, XIV, which was bought by IBM  in January 2008 (IBM paid an estimated $300 million for a company invested in with an estimated $3 million). Yanai continued leading XIV and became an IBM Fellow. The IBM XIV Storage System became an IBM storage product. Shortly later, in April 2008, IBM bought Diligent Technologies, another storage company co-founded by Yanai. He left IBM in 2010. In 2011 he founded Infinidat, a computer data storage company. In April 2015, Infinidat announced a $150 million investment led by TPG Capital. This investment placed it among the most valuable privately held companies.


Yanai is an inventor or co-inventor of about 40 US patents in the field of electronic data storage.


In June 2011 his Alma mater,  Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, awarded him the honor Distinguished Fellow of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, and in 2012, conferred upon him an Honorary Doctorate. He has been a board of directors member of several companies. Also in 2011, Infinidat announced Moshe became its CEO.",0,11 November 2010, 29 August 2021,103,1,1

63276352,The Longing (video game),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longing_(video_game),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Longing_(video_game)&action=info,"The Longing is an indie point-and-click adventure idle video game, developed by Studio Seufz. Initially released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on March 5, 2020, and later for Nintendo Switch on April 14, 2021, the game follows a creature called a Shade, who waits 400 days to awaken a sleeping king. During this wait, the Shade must find ways to pass the time. The game is notable in that the in-game four hundred days pass in real-time, regardless of whether or not the player opens the game.  The plot of the game is based on the legend of KyffhÃ¤user. The Longing received positive reviews and was praised for its experimental nature.


The gameplay of The Longing revolves around a real-time countdown of 400 days as the player character, called a Shade, waits to awaken its king. Interaction with the world is slow-paced by design, with the Shade's movement speed being significantly slow. The gameplay consists mostly of exploring caves, gathering resources to furnish the Shade's home, and other time-wasting activities such as reading[a] and drawing. Many aspects of the game are time-dependent, for instance, roadblocks which require the player to wait a certain amount of time before progressing. The game is intended to, at least in part, be played idly, enabled by features such as idle reading and a bookmark system, by which the player can direct the Shade to automatically walk to a previously saved location, return to its home, or randomly wander around.


The player's main goals are driven by a to-do list of things to improve the Shade's life, however, no interaction with the game world is required to advance the timer, as it continues regardless of what actions are taken[b] and increments independently of the game being open. Time advances faster in the Shade's home depending on how well-furnished it is, as well as while performing certain actions such as drawing. As a result of the timer's constant progression, it is possible to beat the game by opening it once, waiting 400 days, then opening it again, although this is not the intended way to play. To prevent cheating, the game also has a dungeon system as a consequence for players who attempt to circumvent the time limit by changing their computer's system clock. The game features several endings, and not all require the player to wait out the 400 day timer.


The Longing's story was largely inspired by the KyffhÃ¤user legend, particularly by a dwarven character within the poem ""KyffhÃ¤user Mountains Barbarossa"" by Friedrich RÃ¼ckert, which was based upon the legend. The dwarf was tasked with checking every 100 years if its king was ready to awaken. Anselm Pyta, director of The Longing, found the character interesting, and focused in on it and its mental state. As such, much of the game was built around the theme of loneliness. The gameplay was inspired by idle games such as Clicker Heroes. Prior to release, a demo of the game was showcased at AdventureX 2020. The game released on March 5, 2020 to Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux, followed by a release for Nintendo Switch on April 14, 2021.


The Longing was received positively by critics, receiving a ""generally favorable"" aggregated score by Metacritic for both PC and Switch versions. In particular it was praised for its experimental nature; PC Gamer's Joakim Kilman called it a ""fascinating experiment"", and Christopher Byrd of The Washington Post spoke of how ""[its] level of creativity reinvigorates my expectation of what games can be"", drawing comparisons to The Witness and The Beginner's Guide, among others. In part due to its release date, Rachel Weber of GamesRadar called it ""the game that best sums up life in the 2020 pandemic"". Some reviewers criticized the game's lack of content; Feronato Emaneule of The Games Machine praised its story, but stated that it ""[clashes] with the lack of puzzles and too many pauses"" and Athanasios Aravositas of Cubed3 stated that ""you won't exactly swim in content while playing it"".",2,3 March 2020, 26 September 2021,151,4,2

200176,Root pressure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_pressure,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Root_pressure&action=info,"Root pressure is the transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.


Root pressure occurs in the xylem of some vascular plants when the soil moisture level is high either at night or when transpiration is low during the day. When transpiration is high, xylem sap is usually under tension, rather than under pressure, due to transpirational pull. At night in some plants, root pressure causes guttation or exudation of drops of xylem sap from the tips or edges of leaves. Root pressure is studied by removing the shoot of a plant near the soil level. Xylem sap will exude from the cut stem for hours or days due to root pressure. If a pressure gauge is attached to the cut stem, the root pressure can be measured.


Root pressure is caused by active distribution of mineral nutrient ions into the root xylem. Without transpiration to carry the ions up the stem, they accumulate in the root xylem and lower the water potential. Water then diffuses from the soil into the root xylem due to osmosis. Root pressure is caused by this accumulation of water in the xylem pushing on the rigid cells. Root pressure provides a force, which pushes water up the stem, but it is not enough to account for the movement of water to leaves at the top of the tallest trees. The maximum root pressure measured in some plants can raise water only to 6.87 meters, and the tallest trees are over 100 meters tall.


The endodermis in the root is important in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the cortex and the pericycle. These cells allow water movement until it reaches the Casparian strip, made of suberin, a waterproof substance. The Casparian strip prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the apoplast pathway. Ions outside the endodermis must be actively transported across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The Casparian strip substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.


Root pressure can transport water and dissolved mineral nutrients from roots through the xylem to the tops of relatively short plants when transpiration is low or zero. The maximum root pressure measured is about 0.6 megapascals but some species never generate any root pressure. The main contributor to the movement of water and mineral nutrients upward in vascular plants is considered to be the transpirational pull. However, sunflower plants grown in 100% relative humidity grew normally and accumulated the same amount of mineral nutrients as plants in normal humidity, which had a transpiration rate 10 to 15 times the plants in 100% humidity. Thus, transpiration may not be as important in upward mineral nutrient transport in relatively short plants as often assumed.


Xylem vessels sometimes empty over winter. Root pressure may be important in refilling the xylem vessels. However, in some species vessels refill without root pressure.


Root pressure is often high in some deciduous trees before they leaf out. Transpiration is minimal without leaves, and organic solutes are being mobilized so decrease the xylem water potential. Sugar maple accumulates high concentrations of sugars in its xylem early in the spring, which is the source of maple sugar. Some trees ""bleed"" xylem sap profusely when their stems are pruned in late winter or early spring, e.g. maple and elm. Such bleeding is similar to root pressure only sugars, rather than ions, may lower the xylem water potential.

He belonged to the abbot family Khon of Sakya which had a precedence position in Tibet in this era. He held the dignity from 1327 to 1330.


Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen was one of the 13 sons of the abbot-ruler of Sakya, Zangpo Pal (d. 1323). His mother was Machig Yondagmo. When his elder brother Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen held the dignity of Dishi, he decreed a division of Zangpo Pal's many sons into four groups, each of which resided in a particular palace (Zhitog, Lhakhang, Rinchengang, and Ducho). Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen belonged to the Lhakhang branch. When the Dishi died in the imperial capital in March 1327, he was summoned by the emperor YesÃ¼n TemÃ¼r to take up the dignity and was formally installed on 17 May 1327. He only arrived to Beijing in the next year, the route from Central Tibet being long and difficult.


During the short tenure of Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen a mysterious incident took place. According to the Yuan shi (History of the Yuan dynasty) a certain Nianzhenqilasi (Rinchen Drak) was elevated to the Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) dignity on 22 December 1329, when Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen was still alive. The closer circumstances are missing in the sources, and it is obvious that Rinchen Drak did not belong to the Khon family. It is possible that he is identical with the Guoshi (State Preceptor) Rinchen Drak who is known to have been literary active in 1325. He might have been temporarily elevated by a faction at the imperial court which strove to exclude the Khon family of Sakya from the office. There was a rapid shift of emperors in 1328-29 which might be the backdrop for this brief alteration. According to the most reliable sources Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen died in 1330 after a term of three years, suggesting that he managed to retain or regain his office in the end. In one version he died as late as in 1339. He was succeeded by his younger brother Kunga Gyaltsen. As common in the Khon family he married and sired children before his full ordination as monk. Of his five children, Sonam Lotro (1332-1362) briefly served as imperial preceptor in 1361-1362, when the Yuan dynasty was already in its death throes. Another son, Drakpa Gyaltsen (1336-1376) was formally viceroy of Tibet in 1360-76, at a time when the Sakya regime had already been replaced by the Phagmodrupa Dynasty.",0,1 January 2015, 17 March 2021,14,0,0

It was the second significant UK contemporary music sampler release in the period.


Transatlantic, founded in 1961, was a prototype for many of the UK independent labels that followed it. It established the UK folk-rock market, first by importing American records, and then by recording British artists. With the advent of psychedelia and flower power, the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved increasing popularity, culminating in the formation of the supergroup Pentangle. Meanwhile, Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the eccentric audio collageist Ron Geesin, and The Purple Gang, whose ""Granny Takes A Trip"" was banned by the BBC in 1967.


CBS had  released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with The Rock Machine Turns You On in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released Listen Here! early in 1968. Like Rock Machine the record was priced at 14/11d (Â£0.75), but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by not only printing the track listing on the front, but also the price.  The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. Listen Here! also served to introduce a new group The Sallyangie, with siblings Mike and Sally Oldfield.

He participated in World War I as a medical officer until he was honorably discharged in 1918. He is well known for prospering an independent African-American economy by his formation of the Baldwin Business Center, St. Mary's Hospital, and Sandy Beach Resort. The institutions were meant to go over the restrictions placed upon African-Americans by Jim Crow laws, preventing entry to white establishments. Baldwin Memorial Park was formed in his honor.


Baldwin was born on March 20, 1881, in Belvoir, North Carolina, and was the oldest child of Reverend James Hayes and Mary Crutchfield Baldwin.  His father was a Methodist priest.  Baldwin's paternal grandfather, Jerry Baldwin, and maternal grandmother, Margaret Crutchfield, were both slaves.  Baldwin worked as a farm worker from a very young age and displayed his intelligence by graduating from the Apex Normal and Industrial Institute at the age of 16 in 1897.  Soon after, Baldwin moved to attend Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina.


The years before the war, Baldwin found it difficult to maintain his practice, but found that it grew more each year by the growing African-American population.  Baldwin married a woman named Vina in 1911. They were situated on Fayette Street, the heart of Martinsville's African American American business district.  At the start of World War I, Baldwin was 36 years old and immediately he volunteered.


Upon entry into the military, Baldwin was commissioned to the Medical Reserve Corps, and, like many of his peers, he was sent for basic training at Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School.  He was given the rank of First Lieutenant.  Fort Des Moines had been opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University.  However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that he had been unfairly assessed for merely being black.  This or discontent with his superior might have been a factor in Baldwin submitting his resignation from the 368th Ambulance Company of the 92nd Division, 317 Sanitary Train post he had been assigned.


Once he arrived in France, Baldwin had the main responsibility of handling sanitation concerns, surgery duties and hospital illnesses.  Much of the 92nd Infantry Division was involved with trench warfare and were aiding the French in pushing back the German forces, who sent a large number of gas attacks into the field.  However, Baldwin found himself mostly concerned with the breakout of influenza which came in September 1918.  A large portion of the Baldwin's patients mostly consisted of illness.  The war came to a close in 1919 and Baldwin was honorably discharged on April 2.


Baldwin returned to Martinsville, and resumed working in his practice.  It was after his military service that Baldwin really began to put an active effort in improving the conditions of the African-American Community.  In the Virginia edition of The History of the American Negro"", Dr. Baldwin stated that in order for the African American community to prosper, people should start ""by advocating and working for better schools, better churches... by seeing to it that children are instructed in civic duty in the schools and taught the importance and power of the ballot.


Many of the white hospitals in the area had barred entrance or denied rights for African-Americans.  In 1929, Dr, Baldwin opened a 27-bed facility meant to house the poor African-American population unable to afford or enter other hospitals.  It was named St. Mary's, for his mother who had encouraged him down the road to medicine.  He coordinated with a younger brother who'd owned his own pharmacy.  The area was designated ""Baldwin Block"".  Baldwin opened a number of other business in the majority of the 1920s and 1930s, including the Sandy Beach Resort, Baldwin Miniature Golf Course, Baldwin's Gymntorium and Baldwin Business Center.  All these facilities were opened to the African American community as the many white institutions were barred because of the Jim Crow laws.


Dr. Baldwin was also a heavy contributor for a number of churches and societies, including AMR Church, the Masons, Old Fellows, Magic City Medical Society and The National Medical Association. Dr. Baldwin was given media attention after treating an African American man for a broken leg and forced the police department to pay his bill regarding the injury.  Baldwin continued his practice for 60 years and never retired.


Dr. Baldwin died of a stroke on November 9, 1972.  He was buried in Wake County, North Carolina, in the Baldwin Burial site, where a number of his family are also buried.


Dr. Baldwin was well remembered in the Martinsville community as being selfless and working with all his might to provide a brighter future for his brethren. The Virginia Foundation for the Humanities erected the Dr. Dana O. Baldwin Memorial Park situated in Baldwin Block.  There are also a number of streets in the area named after him.  St. Mary's stayed open until 1952 and was memorialized in an exhibit made by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities.


On December 24, 1911, Baldwin married Vina S. Flood, daughter of L. F. and Elizabeth Flood.  Vina had been educated in Hatshorn College and was a teacher in a number of local public schools.  The couple did not have children of their own.  However, they adopted two girls: Mae and Rosa Baldwin.  The couple also raised another three boys and one girl as foster children.",0,5 October 2016, 9 January 2021,52,0,0

The mosque is situated at Ankara Street northwest of the historic Sublime Porte building, which is the Istanbul Governor's Office today, at CaÄaloÄlu quarter of Fatih district of old Istanbul, Turkey.


It was built by Ä°mam Ali Efendi, a relative of Ottoman religious scholar, poet and mystic saint Akshamsaddin (1389â1459) during the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (reigned 1444â1446, 1451â1481) in the 15th century. Originally, the mosque was situated within the yard of the Sublime Porte Building with one side on Ankara Street. It came to appearance when the traffic on the Ankara Street became limited due to the construction of Marmaray. Ä°mam Ali Efendi's grave is found behind the close Cevdet Pasha Library building. It was turned into a mosque after Grand vizier HekimoÄlu Ali Pasha's (1689â1758) brother Feyzullah Efendi built a minbar. The building burnt down during the Fire of Sublime Porte (Turkish: Bab-Ä± Ali YangÄ±nÄ±) in the 1800s. According to the inscription calligraphed by Mustafa Ä°zzet Efendi, the mosque was rebuilt in 1869. A second inscription by Sami Efendi states its restoration in 1902.


The mosque is designed in eclectic architectural style and some details are used which are normally seen in the Indian and Iranian architecture. It is painted today in red and white, although the original color was yellow and beige. It has a square-plan of 8.50Â m ÃÂ 8.50Â m (27.9Â ft ÃÂ 27.9Â ft) dimensions. It has one dome sitting on an octagonal haunch. The mosque's only minaret was built in ashlar, and has one balcony.


The mosque takes its name ""NallÄ±"" (literally: horseshoe) from reliefs of horseshoe figures found on the minaret.",0,4 July 2019, 25 January 2021,18,0,0

Other court cases determined that television stations are federally licensed, so local rating boards have no jurisdiction over films shown on television.

Sanford was born in New Haven, Connecticut.  He graduated from Yale University and pursued a successful career as a surgeon.  However, his main interest throughout his life was ornithology.  He became an Associate of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1902, and a Life Associate in 1919.


Although Sanford was elected a trustee of the museum in February 1921, his association with the institution had begun much earlier.  As well as acquiring many specimens of rare and extinct species for the museum's collection, he instigated a major collecting expedition to South America by persuading philanthropist Frederick F. Brewster of New Haven to finance it.  The Brewster-Sanford Expedition, headed by Rollo Beck, took place from 1912 to 1917 and produced a large number of specimens, providing the basis for studies resulting in the publication of Robert Cushman Murphyâs two-volume âOceanic Birds of South Americaâ.


Sanford was also instrumental in establishing the long-term relationship between philanthropist Harry Payne Whitney and the museum, which first saw Whitney financing the Whitney Memorial Wing of the museum, which housed the department of birds there.  Subsequently, Whitney sponsored the extensive Whitney South Seas Expedition, which lasted from 1921 to 1932, making biological and anthropological collections through Micronesia, Polynesia and Melanesia.  Even after Whitney's death in 1930, Sanford persuaded his widow, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, and children to acquire for the museum the huge bird collection, of some 280,000 specimens, of Lord Rothschildâs private museum at Tring in England. He also initiated the Blossom Expedition, which took place from 1923 to 1926 and procured specimens from Africa, South America, and the South Atlantic for the collections of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. As the American Museum's Whitney South Sea Expedition was similar in purpose, the museums agreed to exchange material from both expeditions to enhance both museums' collections.


Sanford died in 1950 at his winter home in Florida.


He is commemorated in the names of Sanford's sea-eagle (Haliaeetus sanfordi ), Sanford's bowerbird (Archboldia sanfordi ), and Sanford's brown lemur (Eulemur sanfordi ). Also, a species of lizard, Sanford's emo skink (Emoia sanfordi ), is named in his honor.",2,6 June 2010, 3 April 2020,37,0,0

She is the 2016 Canadian national junior silver medalist and has represented Canada at two Four Continents Championships, finishing within the top ten in 2020. She has also competed on the Grand Prix series.


Pineault was born on July 26, 1999, in Montreal. She studied at Ãcole Secondaire de Mortagne before enrolling at CÃ©gep Ãdouard-Montpetit.


Pineault began learning to skate in 2003. Coached by StÃ©phane Yvars and FranÃ§oise ParisÃ© in Boucherville, she won silver in the novice ladies' category at the 2015 Canadian Championships and silver in the junior ranks at the 2016 Canadian Championships.


In September 2016, Pineault appeared at the ISU Junior Grand Prix in the Czech Republic, finishing tenth. Competing on the senior level, she placed seventh at the 2017 Canadian Championships.


Making her international senior debut, Pineault placed sixth at the 2017 CS U.S. Classic in September. In January, she finished eighth at the 2018 Canadian Championships and was selected to compete at the 2018 Four Continents Championships in Taipei; she placed fourteenth in the short program, twelfth in the free skate, and thirteenth overall in Taiwan.


Pineault finished sixth at the 2018 CS Autumn Classic International. In October, she was invited to compete at her first Grand Prix event, the 2018 Skate Canada International, following the withdrawals of Gabrielle Daleman and Larkyn Austman.  Pineault had to withdraw from the 2019 Canadian Championships after spraining her ankle in two places in the practice sessions.


Pineault placed seventh at the 2019 CS U.S. Classic at the beginning of the season.  Competing at Skate Canada International for the second consecutive season, she was eleventh of twelve skaters.


Pineault placed first in the short program at the 2020 Canadian Championships despite having an underrotation called on the second part of her jump combination.  She had more difficulty in the free skate, landing only two triple jumps cleanly, and dropped to fourth place overall.  Because national champion Emily Bausback lacked the senior technical minimum for the short program to be assigned to the 2020 World Championships, Skate Canada deferred making a decision about assigning its two berths there until after the 2020 Four Continents Championships in Seoul. As national bronze medalist Madeline Schizas was ineligible for international senior competitions, Pineault was assigned to Four Continents along with Bausback and silver medalist Alison Schumacher.


At the Four Continents, Pineault placed tenth with personal best results in both the free skate and total score.  She was the highest-ranking Canadian woman at the event, besting Schumacher (in fourteenth place) by almost 23 points.  After Pineault's result at Four Continents, she was assigned to compete at the 2020 World Championships, The championships were subsequently cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.


Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Grand Prix assignments were made based on training location, and Pineault was assigned to 2020 Skate Canada International. After the event was cancelled, she announced that due to ongoing uncertainties surrounding the season, she would not compete the rest of the season. Pineault instead took the time to follow doctors' recommendations to ""tune some physiological aspects"" and recover from injuries.

Before 1814, the history of nobility was separate for each of the Dutch provinces. In the Early Middle Ages, there were, in each province, a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so, than the rulers themselves. In old times, no title other than knight existed.


In the middle of the fourteenth century, quarrels between the feudal lords reduced many families and castles to ruins, contributing to the Dukes of Burgundys' acquisition by conquest or inheritance of many of the provinces forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.


In 1581, representatives of the Seven Provinces abjured Philip II of Spain, heir of the Dukes of Burgundy. This left a great part of the executive and legislative power to the Ridderschap (knight) of each province, which consisted of the representatives of those families of the old feudal nobility.


In 1795, the Batavian Revolution did away with their power, and it was not before 1813, when William I became King of the Netherlands, that they were again given power in another form. Still, by the time of the constitution of 1848, they had no influence in government affairs.


In 1813, if no higher title was recognised, the men only were to bear the hereditary predicate of Jonkheer. Some old feudal families obtained the title of Baron or Baroness for all their descendants.


Older nobility, having been granted their titles by either the Holy Roman Emperors or French Kings long before 1813, held their pre-existent titles, which were confirmed in the new Kingdom of the Netherlands (such as the families Bentinck, Limburg Stirum and Van Rechteren). In some of these families it is more usual that only the oldest male descendant bears the family title while other descendants bear the predicate of Jonkheer (m) or Jonkvrouw (f).


The title Duke/Duchess (Hertog in Dutch) is no longer in existence in noble families of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in this day and age.

2122524,Black Cat Track,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Cat_Track,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Cat_Track&action=info,"The Black Cat Track or Trail is a rough overland track in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. It runs from the village of Salamaua on the coast of the Huon Gulf, south into the mountains to the township of Wau. In the 21st century despite being a difficult journey it became a hiking destination for international trekkers.


The name is taken from the Black Cat Gold Mine in Wau. It is also known as the Skindawai Track.


The track started out in the 1920s and 30s as a trail for prospectors seeking to get rich on the gold in Wau. They traveled from the port Salamaua on a treacherous 3 to 4-day hike through leech-infested territory, a trail that recently has been described as ""suitable only for masochists and Israeli Paratroopers"".


Before Errol Flynn (who grew up in Australia and New Guinea) became an actor in 1933, he hiked this trail and commented that it was a rigorous march through leech-infested jungle, in constant fear of ambush, and lying awake at night wondering ""whether that crawly sound you heard a few feet away might be a snake, a cassowary or maybe only a wild boar razorback ... I have seen Central Africa, but it was never anything like the jungle of New Guinea.""


On 8 March 1942 in World War II, the town of Salamaua was captured by the Japanese. They had tried to take Port Moresby by sea, but were defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Now they were going to take it by land. They tried to take the capital by going over the Owen Stanley mountain range, by the Kokoda Track, basing the operation out of Salamaua. They almost made it this time but were pushed back 30 miles short of the city, in a series of bloody battles. After this they converted Salamaua into a major supply base. After a few months had passed, they made their final attempt at Port Moresby, the Black Cat Trail. If they could capture the Allied Air Base in Wau, they could launch an offensive on the capital that would have overwhelmed the Australians, Americans, and Papua New Guinea Militia stationed there.


The Japanese attacked in force, but the Australian 17th Brigade, under Major-General Stanley Savige, held out until reinforcements (The three independent companies 2/3rd, 2/5th and 2/7th) arrived. Then on 23 April, the allies struck back along the trail, taking it until the hills called The Pimple, and Observation Hill. The Japanese were firmly entrenched there. The 2/7th attacked The Pimple, with mortar support, after it had been strafed by four aircraft, but the Japanese were too firmly entrenched, and the Australian advance was halted. The next day, they attacked again, supported by aircraft and the 1st mountain battery, limited to fifty rounds a gun, but again the attack failed. On 7 May, they attacked again, but again were driven back. Then on 9 May, the Japanese launched their own attack in the Pimple area. They surrounded the foremost Australian Company and started closing in. The Australians were not relieved until the afternoon of 11 May. By this time they had withstood eight attacks from parts of two Japanese battalions. The following day, they took The Pimple, supported by field guns, where before there had been only two mountain batteries.


The 2/3rd battalion had been pressing along while the 2/7th tried to take The Pimple, and in early May, they came to the Bobdubi Ridge. Seeing that it was only lightly held, they attacked it, and captured it on 4 May. They then held off all Japanese trying to retake it. From Bobdubi, the 2/3rd battalion severely harassed the Japanese. Their tactics were so successful that Major-General Savige had to tell them not to attempt too much, as ""premature commitments in the Salamaua area could not be backed at present by an adequate force."" Then on 14 May, the Japanese launched a full-scale attack, supported by guns and mortars, forcing the Australians to withdraw. On the 15th, over 100 Japanese planes attacked Australian positions in three raids, and on the 17th and 18th they raided the Wau airdrome.


In late May the 2/6th battalion arrived to relieve the 2/7th, and the 15th brigade headquarters and another battalion of that brigade started arriving in Savige's area. In mid June, the allies started acting as if they were going to attack Salamaua, but really the target was Lae, on the other side of the Huon Gulf. The Japanese fell for this and on the 19th and 20th, they seemed to anticipate an attack, and started patrolling aggressively. The plan worked as planned, but the allies didn't attack until early September. On 26 August, General Milford relieved Savige, with his 5th division headquarters. Salamaua was captured on 11 September 1943, a week after the Lae offensive began. Five days later Lae was taken.


The Black Cat Track is a tough course recommended only for ""very fit and experienced trekkers"".


On 10 September 2013 a trekking expedition was attacked by bandits known as Rascals. Two expedition porters were killed in the attack, and another died from the effects of wounds inflicted during the attack. Six people were arrested. The expedition's porters were targeted much more than the international trekkers, and the attack is believed to have been caused by a grudge related to money and the hiring of porters from different villages along the trekking route.

Frith OAM is an English born Australian citizen and ornithologist. She is now a self-employed private, independent, zoological researcher, consultant, natural history author, and publisher. 


Dawn obtained her PhD, in littoral zone marine biology on a study of the biology of animals living on the littoral sponges with special reference to Halichondria panicea (Pallas), at London University and lectured in zoology before meeting Clifford Brodie Frith on Aldabra Atoll, Indian Ocean where she was a visiting scientist studying insects and he a staff scientist studying birds. Their full-time partnership began in April 1973. They married at Bangkok Central Police Station, in October 1975. In December 1977, they moved to tropical north Queensland, Australia, to start decades of field studies of bowerbirds and birds-of-paradise and other rainforest-dwelling bird species in tropical eastern Australia and in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Together they have published some 150 substantial scientific papers in international peer-reviewed zoological journals. Their studies are largely self-funded by proceeds from their own publishing partnership.


Dawn has written and illustrated many semi-scientific and popular articles in magazines worldwide, has acted as scientific and/or technical adviser and/or associate producer to various feature and television film makers. She has much experience of giving personal presentations at both popular and scientific levels, and also carries out ecological and avifaunal surveys for various environmental agencies in tropical north Queensland, Australia.


Dawn started her professional career as a zoology lecturer in England (1968â1973) before taking a year's absence from her position as a visiting scientist at the Royal Society of London Research Station Aldabra Atoll, Western Indian Ocean. Her research was focused on monitoring populations of terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates on Aldabra. All collected material was deposited at the British Museum (Natural History), London. In 1974, she became a senior marine biologist/advisor at Phuket Marine Biological Centre, Phuket Island, Thailand, being employed by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DANIDA), Copenhagen, Denmark.


Since 1977, Dawn, with Clifford B. Frith, has studied various aspects of tropical rainforest avifauna in Australia, New Guinea and elsewhere for over three decades. Her studies have resulted in many scientific publications (84 to date) on the behaviour, nesting biology, mating systems, and systematics of bowerbirds, birds-of-paradise, and other rainforest-dwelling bird species. Her systematic scientific studies have resulted in a major ""definitive"" ornithological text book - The Bowerbirds: Ptilonorhynchidae. She has performed part-time lecturing in Australia: at Monash University, Victoria and James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland.


In 1992, Dawn was awarded the Certificate of Honour by the Phuket Marine Biological Center ""in recognition of support of the PMBC's endeavours in conducting research on marine science and conservation of marine environment and resources in Thailand"".


In 1996, she was awarded the D. L. Serventy Medal for Ornithology, jointly with her husband Clifford B. Frith, by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union - for original contributions to Australasian ornithology of international significance. They were also jointly awarded the 2006 Cassowary Award by the Australian Wet Tropics Authority â for the Arts Category ""for an outstanding contribution to aesthetic appreciation of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area"". In 2008 they were awarded the prestigious Whitley Book Award in the Field Natural History section for their book Bowerbirds: Nature. Art & History. In 2011 they were awarded the prestigious Whitley Book Award for in the Popular Zoology section for their book Birds of Paradise: Nature, Art & History.


On June 14, 2021 Dawn was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for contributions ""to conservation and the environment"".


In July 1984 Dawn and Clifford established their small publishing house (initially and briefly called Tropical Australia Graphics and then Frith & Frith books) producing eleven high quality full colour natural history books: including the second edition of the large hardback book Daintree- Where the Rainforest Meets the Reef by Rupert Russell in 1994; and the second edition of the large hardback Cape York Peninsula: a Natural History by Clifford Frith and Dawn Frith. They also self-published the two large hardback books: Bowerbirds: Nature, Art & History (2008) and Birds of Paradise: Nature, Art & History (2010) written, designed and illustrated by themselves.

59964,Senufo people,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senufo_people,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Senufo_people&action=info,"The Senufo people, also known as Siena, Senefo, Sene, Senoufo, and SyÃ©nambÃ©lÃ©, are a West African ethnolinguistic group. They consist of diverse subgroups living in a region spanning the northern Ivory Coast, the southeastern Mali and the western Burkina Faso. One sub-group, the Nafana, is found in north-western Ghana.


The Senufo people are predominantly animists, with some who are Muslims. They are regionally famous for their handicrafts, many of which feature their cultural themes and religious beliefs.


In the 1980s, estimates placed the total ethnic group population of Senufo people somewhere between 1.5 and 2.7 million. A 2013 estimate places the total over 3 million, with majority of them living in Ivory Coast in places such as Katiola, and some 0.8 million in southeastern Mali. Their highest population densities are found in the land between the Black Volta river, Bagoe River and Bani River.


Their kinship organization is matrilineal. Typically, the Senufo people are studied in three large subgroups that have been relatively isolated. The northern Senufo are called ""Supide or Kenedougou"", found near Odienne, and who helped found an important kingdom of West Africa and challenged Muslim missionaries and traders. The southern Senufo are the largest group, numbering over 2 million, who allowed Muslim traders to settle within their communities in the 18th century who actively proselytized, and about 20% of the southern Senufo are Muslims. The third group is very small and isolated from both northern and southern Senufo. Some sociologists such as the French scholar Holas mentions fifteen identifiable sub-groups of Senufo people, with thirty dialects and four castes scattered between them.


The term Senufo refers to a linguistic group comprising roughly thirty related dialects within the larger Gur language family.  It belongs to the Gur-branch of the Niger-Congo language family, and consists of four distinct languages namely Palaka(also spelt Kpalaga), Djimini(also spelt Dyimini), and Senari in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Suppire( also spelt Supyire) in Mali, as well as Karaboro in Burkina Faso. Within each group, numerous subdivisions use their own names for the people and language; the name Senufo is of external origin. Palaka separated from the main Senufo stock well before the 14th century ad; at about that time, with the founding of the town of Kong as a Bambara trade-route station, the rest of the population began migrations to the south, west, and north, resulting in the present divisions.The Senufo speaking people range from 800,000 to one million and live in agricultural based communities predominately located in the CÃ´te d'Ivoire, West Africa, Africa.


Korhogo, an ancient town in northern Ivory Coast dating from the 13th century, is linked to the Senufo people. This separation of languages and sub-ethnic groups may be linked to the 14th-century migrations with its founding along with the Bambara trade-route.


The Senufo people emerged as a group sometime within the 15th or 16th century. They were a significant part of the 17th to 19th-century KÃ©nÃ©dougou Kingdom (literally ""country of the plain"") with the capital of Sikasso. This region saw many wars including the rule of Daoula Ba TraorÃ©, a cruel despot who reigned between 1840 and 1877. The Islamisation of the Senufo people began during this historical period of the KÃ©nÃ©dougou Kingdom, but it was the kings & chiefs who converted, while the general Senufo population refused. Daoula Ba TraorÃ© attempted to convert his kingdom to Islam, destroying many villages within the kingdom such as Guiembe and Nielle in 1875 because they resisted his views. The KÃ©nÃ©dougou dynastic rulers attacked their neighbors as well, such as the Zarma people and they in turn counterattacked many times between 1883 and 1898.


The pre-colonial wars and violence led to their migration into Burkina Faso in regions that became towns such as Tiembara in Kiembara Department. The KÃ©nÃ©dougou kingdom and the TraorÃ© dynasty were dissolved in 1898 with the arrival of French colonial rule.


The Senufo people were both victims of and perpetrators of slavery as they victimized other ethnic groups by enslavement. They were enslaved by various African ethnic groups as the Denkyira and Akan states were attacked or fell in the 17th and 18th centuries. They themselves bought and sold slaves to Muslim merchants, Asante people and BaoulÃ© people. As refugees from other West African ethnic groups escaped wars, states Paul Lovejoy, some of them moved into the Senufo lands, seized their lands and enslaved them.


The largest demand for slaves initially came from the markets of Sudan, and for a long time, slave trading was one an important economic activity across the Sahel and West Africa, states Martin Klein. Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso were important sources of slaves captured who were then moved to Timbuktu and Banamba on their way to the Sudanese and Mauritanian slave markets.


Those enslaved in Senufo lands worked the land, herds and served within the home. Their owner and his dependents also had the right to have sexual intercourse with female domestic slaves. The children of a female slave inherited her slave status.


The Senufo are predominantly an agricultural people cultivating corn, millet, yams, and peanut. Senufo villages consist of small mud-brick homes. In the rainy southern communities of Senufo, thatched roofs are common, while flat roofs are prevalent in dry desert-like north. The Senufo is a patriarchal extended family society, where arranged typically cousin marriage and polygyny has been fairly common, however, succession and property inheritance has been matrilineal.


As agriculturalists, they cultivate a wide variety of crops, including cotton and cash crops for the international market. As musicians, they are world renowned, playing a multitude of instruments from: wind instruments (Aerophones), stringed instruments (Chordaphones) and percussive instruments                   (Membranophones). Senufo communities use a caste system, each division known as a katioula. In this system the farmers, known as Fo no, and the artisans at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The term artisan encompasses different individual castes within Senufo society including blacksmiths (Kule), carvers (Kpeene), brasscutters (Tyeli), potterers, and leather workers, whose lives revolve around the roles, responsibilities, and structures inhabited by the individual class. Training to become an artisan takes about seven or eight years; commencing with an apprenticeship where the trainees create objects not associated with the religion of the Senufo, then culminating with an initiation process where they obtain the ability to create ritual object.


Regionally, the Senufo are famous as musicians and superb carvers of wood sculpture, masks, and figurines. The Senufo people have specialized their art and handicraft work by subgroups, wherein the art is learnt within this group, passed from one generation to the next. The Kulubele specialize as woodcarvers, the Fonombele specialize in blacksmith and basketry work, the Kpeembele specialize in brass casting, the Djelebele are renowned for leatherwork, the Tchedumbele are masters of gunsmith work, while Numu specialize in smithing and weaving. Outside the artisan subgroups, the Senufo people have hunters, musicians, grave-diggers, diviners, and healers who are called the Fejembele. Among these various subgroups, the leatherworkers or Djelebele are the ones who have most adopted Islam, although those who convert retain many of their animist practices.


Traditionally, the Senufo people have been a socially stratified society, similar to many West African ethnic groups having castes. These endogamous divisions are locally called Katioula, and one of the strata in this division includes slaves and descendants of slaves. According to Dolores Richter, the caste system found among Senufo people features ""hierarchical ranking including despised lower castes, occupational specificity, ritual complementarity, endogamy, hereditary membership, residential isolation, and the political superiority of farmers over artisan castes"".


The Senufo people usually fall within four societies in their culture: Poro, Sandogo, Wambele, or Tyekpa. While all the societies fill particular roles in the governance and education of the Senufo people, the Poro and Sandogo. Spirituality and divination are divided between these two gender-imperative societies with women falling under the Sando or Sandogo society, and men falling under the Poro society with the exception of men who are members of those of the women because of their mother. These societies are the two that create the majority of commissioned Seunfo art.



Typically, the Senufo villages are independent of each other, and each has a male secret society called Poro with elaborate initiation rituals in a patch of forest they consider as sacred. The initiation rituals involve masks, figurines, and ritual equipment that the Senufo people carve and have perfected. The secrecy has helped the Senufo people to preserve their culture in the times of wars and political pressure. Senufo wear specially-crafted brass jewelry, such as those mimicking wildlife. 

""The main function of Poro is to guarantee a good relationship between the living world and the ancestors. Nerejao is an ancestress who is recognized as the true head of the Poro society. Divination, which is governed by the Sandogo society, is also an important part of Senufo religion. Although Sandogo is usually considered a women's society, men who are called to the profession and inherit through the matrilineal line are permitted to become diviners.""

The Sandogo are women diviners among the Senufo people. They have their own rituals and secret order. In addition, the Senufo people have Wambele and Typka, who perform sorcery and rituals.


Within Senufo culture, the female form is held above all others in terms of beauty and aesthetics and caryatid figures are seen with various cultural connotations. This is tied into the worship of the spirit, ""Ancient Mother"", or the spirit, ""mother"", Maleeo, who is revered as the guiding entity by all Poro society initiates and members. The goddess Maleeo has a partner, the god Kolocolo, who is seen as the identifying deity of the Sandogo, who granted the people marriage and this particular type of lineage to allow communication from humanity and the spirit world. Caryatid figures are seen as representations of the role of women as spiritual mediators and the Sandogo use them in ceremonies as symbols of this bilateral celestial discourse. Likewise, in the case of the Poro, there are writings about caryatid figures being used in ceremonies where they are brought out to commemorate advancement in the age-grade cycle, as well as being used to raise funds by initiates of the society. Calved figures were used in a tyekpa funeral ceremony as dance sculpture, held upon the head of the dancers while the ceremony takes place.


The traditional Senufo religion is a type of animism. This Senufo belief includes ancestral and nature spirits, who may be contacted. They believe in a Supreme Being, who is viewed in a dual female-male: an Ancient Mother, Maleeo or Katieleo, and a male Creator God, Kolotyolo or Koulotiolo.


The art of Senufo people inspired twentieth-century European artists such as Pablo Picasso and Fernand LÃ©ger. The cubism and masks found in Senufo pieces were a significant influence for Pablo Picasso's African period.


The term Senufo has become a category to art collectors and scholars, a symbolism for the artistic traditions of West Africa, starting with the early twentieth century. Old pieces of Senufo art are found in many leading museums of the world.

Turgot came from the Kingdom of Lindsey in Lincolnshire. After the Norman conquest he was held as a hostage, but escaped to Norway, where he taught king Olaf psalmody. In about 1074 he returned to England and became a clerk at Jarrow monastery. He then became a monk at Wearmouth, and in 1087 he was appointed prior of the monastery at Durham, from 1093 combining this with the archdeaconry of Durham. He became close to the Scottish court, and between 1100 and 1107 he wrote the life of Malcolm's wife, Saint Margaret of Scotland, at the request of her daughter, Matilda, wife of king Henry I of England.


In 1093, he and Bishop William de St-Calais laid the foundation stone for what would later become Durham Cathedral.


In 1107, the Prior was elected bishop of St Andrews. Consecration was delayed by ecclesiastical disputes between York and St Andrews, and did not take place until 1 August 1109. According to Symeon of Durham, he found that he could not exercise the office ""worthily"", and resolved to go to Rome, but he was prevented by the king. He then became ill and was allowed to return to Durham, where he died on 31 August 1115.",4,9 December 2002, 13 May 2021,72,0,0
3690077,Caldera OpenLinux,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera_OpenLinux,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caldera_OpenLinux&action=info,"Caldera OpenLinux (COL) is a defunct Linux distribution that was originally introduced by Caldera in 1997 based on the German LST Power Linux distribution, and then taken over and further developed by Caldera Systems (now SCO Group) since 1998. A successor to the Caldera Network Desktop put together by Caldera since 1995, OpenLinux was an early ""business-oriented distribution"" and foreshadowed the direction of developments that came to most other distributions and the Linux community generally.[citation needed]


Corsair, a user interface for NetWare, was a project run by Novell corporation's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) between 1993 and 1995. Novell wanted a desktop environment with internet connectivity and conducted research on how to better and more easily integrate and manage network access for users. Windows' own support for connecting to Novell networks would not be improved until later releases and the Internet was dominated by Unix-based operating systems. Relative to their needs, Novell deemed the Unixes of the day were too hardware intensive, too large, and charged too much in license fees.


This group became convinced that Linux offered the best possible answer for the OS component.[when?] There were many other components as well, and these were of particular interest:[citation needed]


On 5 April 1994, the Board of Novell hired Robert Frankenberg, the general manager of Hewlett-Packard Personal Information Products Group to replace Raymond John Noorda as CEO of Novell. Novell's stock price had performed poorly recently due to flagging growth. At Novell, the Network division (NSG) was growing at a pace of 19% per year, the Unix business division (USG) was flat, and the Desktop Applications division (DSG) was shrinking at a rate of $400 million per year.[citation needed]


Frankenberg's initiative was to refocus the company on networking and networking services. In terms of Corsair, that meant shedding most of the pieces. The Advanced Technology Group was disbanded, which shut down Willows and the OS project. Negotiations started which would eventually lead to WordPerfect being sold off to Corel in January 1996. Ferret was in line with the new direction and this component was kept within Novell.


Through his Noorda Family Trust (NFT), Ray Noorda had founded a venture capital investment group called the Canopy Group two years earlier in 1992. He thought there was substantial promise in both the OS project and the Willows project. He created two companies, to continue the work started at Novell. The ""API company"" was called Willows Software, Inc. (founded 1993[citation needed]) and the ""OS company"" became Caldera, Inc. (founded in October 1994 and incorporated in January 1995).


Noorda's early vision for Caldera was to create an IPX-based version of Linux which would license the key components, and resell this technology back to Novell to continue the Internet Desktop. In effect, in 1994 Caldera started life as kind of an outsourcing project for Novell,[citation needed] based on a technology demo named ExposÃ©. Caldera started with ten employees and most were from Novell: Bryan Wayne Sparks, founder/president (Novell); Bryce J. Burns, chief operations officer (Novell); Ransom H. Love, VP marketing (Novell); Greg Page, VP engineering (Bell Labs, AT&T); and Craig Bradley, VP Sales (Lotus, Word Perfect).[citation needed]


At this point in 1995 Ransom Love and Ray Noorda took note of the technologies that Caldera put together, specifically:


More than just a component for Novell, Caldera had assembled the components needed to create a VAR platform. However, Caldera faced a bootstrapping problem. OEM VAR applications often depended crucially on other companies' commercial applications. Since these other applications hadn't been ported to Linux yet, they couldn't meaningfully port their own applications. Caldera responded by creating a binary applications package, which allowed Linux to run UnixWare and OpenServer applications, the Linux Application Binary Interface (ABI) project,[citation needed] and by assisting Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in creating the Linux Kernel Personalities.[disputed (for: LKP did not arrive until years later)Â  â discuss] Linux Kernel Personalities was worked on to bring Linux application compatibility to SCO Unix (formerly UnixWare) and OpenServer. ""The idea was to enable developers to write for both, Unix and Linux, with a common Application Programming Interface (API) and common Application Binary Interface (ABI). That way, developers didn't have to work so hard, and Unix users, the client base we inherited from SCO, could run Linux applications.""[disputed (for: Cited source is talking about post-SCO acquisition Caldera International, not Caldera Network Desktop era)Â  â discuss]


Caldera also supported Alan Cox in his work on SMP.[when?] If Linux displaced Unix on the Intel x86 platform, then Sun Microsystems wouldn't have a low-end Unix path. This point becomes more interesting in light of SCO's litigation eight years later against IBM in 2003.[relevant?] That is, IBM was not the company involved in the SMP work, and moreover, the company most directly involved is the company that later became the SCO Group, essentially SCO suing IBM for work it itself did.[citation needed]


In 1995, when XFree86 was still very hard to configure and unreliable on most chipsets, Caldera had shipped with MetroLink's Motif and XI Graphic's Accelerated-X.


Known releases:


Caldera Network Desktop was produced and sold until March 1997.


During 1996, Caldera continued to be a valuable player, for example, on 23 May 1996, at the Linux Kongress in Berlin, Germany, Caldera announced its plans to obtain POSIX and FIPS certifications and the X/Open brand for UNIX 95 and XPG4 BASE 95 for the Linux operating system kernel and ""Open Linux"".


In contrast to CND OpenLinux was based on LST Power Linux, a Slackware-derived distribution that had been maintained by Linux Support Team since 1993 and the first to come with a Linux 2.0 kernel. In 1996 Linux Support Team grew into Stefan Probst's and Ralf Flaxa's company LST Software GmbH (with LST now standing for Linux System Technology) in Erlangen, Germany. The OpenLinux development led them to become Caldera's German development center Caldera Deutschland GmbH since May 1997.


On 23 July 1996, Caldera purchased Novell DOS and the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell in order to bundle a DOS with their version of Linux, which led to creating the OpenDOS distribution to help port DOS applications.[nb 1]


Caldera supported the Linux-port of StarOffice 3.1 with ca. 800.000Â DM in order to offer the product with their forthcoming OpenLinux distribution in 1997.


By 1997, when the OpenLinux distribution was first released, Caldera had taken on the form that it would be most remembered for. Caldera had switched over to the high end Linux product. The ""business"" Linux distribution became more rich with features with bundled proprietary software. However, it became less community oriented and was released less frequently than other Linuxes did.[citation needed] Other differences included automated configuration for administration tools, paid technical support staff, built-in consistent default GUI, and a range of supported applications.


Over the next[when?] five years, Caldera Systems offered additional commercial extensions to Linux. They licensed Sun's Wabi to allow people to run Windows applications under Linux. Additionally, they shipped with Linux versions of WordPerfect (from Novell and later Corel) and CorelDRAW. Since many of their customers used a dual boot setup and FIPS was unreliable, they shipped with PowerQuest's PartitionMagic to allow their customers to non-destructively repartition their hard disks.


In partnership with IBM they produced the first Linux distribution which was DB2 compatible. With the Oracle Corporation they became the target platform for the Linux port of the Oracle database.


Other ventures included starting the Blackdown Java project,[citation needed] and creating professional certification.


They also formed strong partnerships with SCO's value-added reseller market[when?] and started laying the groundwork for OEM sales of Unix-based vertical applications.


Caldera Systems offered three versions of OpenLinux:



In addition to other people's applications, they created many Linux extensions to fill voids where no other commercial company was. 

 Caldera Systems began working[when?] on a Linux equivalent of replacing the Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Outlook that would eventually become Volution Messaging Server, which offered calendaring/scheduling options with shared busy/free information, SSL support for e-mail and easy configuration. Additionally, Caldera Deutschland created the first fully graphical installer for Linux, called Lizard, starting in November 1998. They invented browser-based Unix system administration, created[citation needed] the webmin project, and employed its developer Jamie Cameron between 1999 and 2001.


Caldera Systems created a full featured GUI system administration tool called Caldera Open Administration System (COAS).[when?] The tool was a unified, easy to use administration tool with a modular design. With its scalability and broad scope abilities, it featured:


OpenLinux showed the Linux community what would be required to create a mainstream desktop OS out of the Linux kernel. In many ways the last ten years[when?] of desktop progress has been to successfully implement what Caldera was attempting to do with the tools they had available using open source software in place of the closed applications. Their technique for this was to utilize commercial software to fill in the largest gaps making their product a ""value add"" and thus they could charge for it. It made them the most commercial and at the same time it made them the most advanced distribution available.


The desktop company became Caldera International under the direction of Ransom Love.[dubious  â discuss]



The focus for the desktop company became mainly marketing and business relationships. There were several reasons for this. The first was that Caldera had won a $280 million lawsuit against Microsoft for DR-DOS and was flush with cash.[citation needed] Secondly, while the Caldera distribution was good, its primary advantages were the use of technologies not owned by Caldera and thus if Caldera were successful its success could (from a technical standpoint) be imitated, by Red Hat, SUSE, TurboLinux, etc. Third, for years Caldera had been competing directly with SCO Unix, but by 1997 Linux outperformed SCO in almost every respect.[citation needed] 

 Making the choice to switch from SCO to Caldera was not a ""no-brainer"" for companies because that also meant a switch of vendors and support organizations. Caldera's SCO acquisition was aimed at eliminating this problem. That is Caldera International's corporate direction became to combine SCO's distribution, marketing and VAR arm with LAMP, and use Project Monterey to develop a 64-bit strategy. What SCO offered was:


From a technical standpoint however Caldera OpenLinux really shone during the Ransom Love years. Their commercial bundling solution continued to work. They had a powerful low bug (by Linux standards) distribution that worked well on a wide range of hardware. They charged a great deal relative to other distributions and were able to generate a very strong profit. Red Hat pulled way ahead of them in terms of US sales and on the global sales front they trailed SUSE and TurboLinux as well, but financially due to the DR-DOS settlement they were the strongest of all the Linux distributions.[disputed (for: refuted by events â Red Hat survived in the Linux business, Caldera did not)Â  â discuss]


Known releases (incomplete):


Other products:


Caldera Systems quickly found itself in a classic business problem where the interests of the existing business conflicted with their growth model. Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) was a much larger company than Caldera Systems had been, and in fact of the $71 million of revenue 90% was from the SCO side of the business. Moreover, Caldera Systems costs $4 in marketing to generate a $1 in sales, SCO was mature and sold itself (mainly to repeat customers). The VAR relationship was even more problematic. Caldera Systems had always sold the ""Linux is SCO but better"" model and had done everything possible to make the transition from SCO to Caldera Systems relatively seamless. Each of the 14,000 SCO resellers made much more from each SCO sale than from sales of Caldera Systems, so they were not anxious to move existing customers from SCO to Linux; and even those, that were supportive of Linux, saw no strong value add for Caldera Systems and often sold Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Caldera Systems had two businesses in direct competition, one, which was a shrinking, but still profitable Unix business, the other a rapidly growing business, that was still hemorrhaging money.


The most logical solution was to establish Caldera Systems as the premier Linux brand. Without the threat from Red Hat, transitioning resellers from SCO to Caldera Systems would be much easier. With this in mind Ransom Love formed an alliance of large business oriented Linux distributions which utilized the KDE desktop, called United Linux. The alliance comprised Caldera International, SUSE Linux, Turbolinux, and Conectiva. Filings from Novell in the SCO Group SCO v. Novell lawsuit showed that this was more than simply a marketing gimmick, and was a real alliance.


Business responded favorably to the movement as IBM and AMD quickly formed partnerships. The Linux Professional Institute adopted United Linux as their standard distribution for training. For the first time there was a Linux distribution with:


SUSE Linux had the engineering, as it had continued to maintain a large technical staff, Caldera International had the global support organization, and Turbo Linux as well as Conectiva brought with growth potential into less flooded markets. This merger was so successful,[disputed (for: in actuality, UnitedLinux was regarded with skepticism by industry observers when it was first announced, and it collapsed less than two years later)Â  â discuss] that Love and Sparks could claim vindication that year when Novell reversed the Frankenberg decision and brought United Linux engineering talent back into the fold with the acquisition of SUSE.


United Linux was rejected by the broader Linux community; the use of per-seat licensing was their most highly controversial decision. More importantly, by the time United Linux was released, Darl McBride had become CEO of Caldera International and the focus had shifted away from Linux.


Caldera International at this point released a Caldera ""Linux distribution""[citation needed][ (November 2019)"">clarification needed] with the OpenUNIX 8 kernel instead of the Linux kernel. Unix has TLI and STREAMS support, which made writing drivers easier. Caldera International proved this by replacing the kernel and yet not having to change much else on a full featured desktop and server ""Linux"".


In 2002, the Caldera International board of directors, including Ralph Yarro, named Darl McBride, formerly with Franklin-Covey, as CEO. The company was renamed The SCO Group. Ransom Love was reassigned to work exclusively on United Linux. After he completed this, he left the company to join Progeny Linux Systems which was aiming to create a professional Debian. He remained there in the capacity of a board member and advisor until 30 April 2007 when Progeny ceased operations.


McBride began to focus on SCO's copyrights. One of McBride's first acts as CEO was to collect $600,000 in back licensing fees that were owed to Caldera International. He cleaned up various Linux-related licensing issues allowing for a new round of financing. Soon thereafter he made strong accusations that Linux had infringed copyrights SCO held on Unix; they claimed to have purchased these copyrights from Novell. Novell denied selling them the Unix copyright, prompting them to sue for slander of title. SCO also initiated lawsuits against IBM and AutoZone, alleging copyright infringements through the use or distribution of Linux; none of these lawsuits have been resolved. SCO has created a division, SCOsource, that owns and licenses their intellectual property; a desktop license is $699.",140,11 January 2006, 27 July 2021,408,0,0

Laker claimed he was introduced to Radomski by teammate David Segui. In March 2008, Laker admitted regretting his decision to take performance-enhancing drugs stating, ""I made a poor decision, a mistake, and all I can do is ask for forgiveness and move on.""


Laker first managed the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, the Cleveland Indians' Short-Season A affiliate, in 2007.  He led the New YorkâPenn League side to a 37-37 record.  However, after just one season, he was moved to the position of ""roving catching instructor"" within the Indians organization and replaced by Travis Fryman.  Laker cited health concerns related to colitis, as the reason for the change.


In December 2009, Laker was named the manager of the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League, an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners.


Laker became hitting coach for the Chicago White Sox triple-A affiliate the Charlotte Knights for the 2011 season. In 2016, he was the hitting coach for the Akron Rubber Ducks in the Cleveland Indians minor league system.


In December 2016, Laker was named assistant hitting coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks for the 2017 season.


The Seattle Mariners announced their hiring of Laker as their hitting coach for the 2019 season.",0,16 March 2006, 16 September 2021,172,1,1

It was discovered by German-French astronomer Hermann Goldschmidt on March 31, 1856, and named after Harmonia, the Greek goddess of harmony. The name was chosen to mark the end of the Crimean War.


The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 3.42 years and a relatively low eccentricity of 0.046. It has a cross-sectional size of 107.6Â km. The spectrum of 40 Harmonia matches an S-type (silicate) in the Tholen classification system, and is similar to primitive achondrite meteorites.

Buller was born in Crediton, Devon, the only daughter of General Sir Redvers Buller and his wife, Lady Audrey, youngest daughter of the 4th Marquess Townshend. She joined the British Red Cross Society and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 she was Deputy County Director of the Voluntary Aid Organisation for Devon. She was asked to establish a hospital in Exeter; by August 1915 the original 160 beds had grown to over 1,400.


Established as the Red Cross Voluntary Aided Hospital, in 1915 it was taken over by the War Office as the Central Military Hospital Exeter and Buller remained as administrator, the only woman to hold such a post in a major military hospital during the war. She was also responsible for forty-four affiliated auxiliary hospitals. By 1918 more than 35,000 patients had passed through the hospital. For her work she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours and also awarded the Royal Red Cross 1st Class (RRC).


After the war, Buller began collecting funds to establish an orthopaedic hospital for children in Devon. In 1927 she opened the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter. In 1937 this was followed by the St Loye's Training Centre for Cripples (which later became St Loye's College for Training the Disabled and is now St Loye's Foundation), also in Exeter. In 1932 she opened the Cripple's Training College (which later became Queen Elizabeth's Training College and is now Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People), which is based in Leatherhead, Surrey. She also founded the British Council for Rehabilitation.


She was an early disability rights pioneer, and often spoke on the subject of disability with great passion and eloquence:


Normality! This is the goal to which every disabled individual, without exception, passionately aspires and which all, in their degrees, can achieve if given the right encouragement and opportunity.


âIn nature thereâs no blemish but the mind.
None can be called deformed but the unkind.â



Shakespeare, with the perception of a poet, saw to the heart of the problem long before the word ârehabilitationâ was added to the English Language. Few of us are without handicaps of one sort or another â moral, psychological, physical. The last category may often be less hampering than either of the others, and those who suffer from them have as good a claim as their fellows to be regarded as ordinary human beings, neither to be recognized nor over-indulged nor segregated. Until this fact is recognized by the community as a whole, legislation, however comprehensive and well designed, will not give to the disabled the status which should be theirs as much for the benefit of the nation generally as for their own.

While dynamical systems, in general, do not have closed-form solutions, linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, and they have a rich set of mathematical properties.  Linear systems can also be used to understand the qualitative behavior of general dynamical systems, by calculating the equilibrium points of the system and approximating it as a linear system around each such point.


In a linear dynamical system, the variation of a state vector 
(an

{\displaystyle N}

-dimensional vector denoted 




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

) equals a constant matrix
(denoted 




A



{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }

) multiplied by 





x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

.  This variation can take two forms: either 
as a flow, in which 




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

 varies 
continuously with time


or as a mapping, in which 





x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

 varies in discrete steps


These equations are linear in the following sense: if 





x

(
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} (t)}

 and 




y

(

{\displaystyle \beta }


are any two scalars.  The matrix

need not be symmetric.


Linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, in contrast to most nonlinear ones.  Occasionally, a nonlinear system can be  solved exactly by a change of variables to a linear system.  Moreover, the solutions of (almost) any nonlinear system can be well-approximated by an equivalent linear system near its fixed points.  Hence, understanding linear systems and their solutions is a crucial first step to understanding the more complex nonlinear systems.

WFAL Falcon Radio is overseen by faculty from Bowling Green State University's School of Mass Communications. In addition to being available online, the station is simulcast via cable radio throughout Northwestern Ohio on Spectrum Cable channel 21.


While operating as a commercial entity since 2008, the station is not licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and has roots in a now-defunct unlicensed carrier current AM station that launched in 1970, from which the unofficial ""WFAL"" call sign was derived. Unlike licensed station WBGU (88.1 FM), which is also owned and operated by the university, WFAL Falcon Radio is primarily used for students wishing to pursue jobs in the radio and communications industry.


What is today WFAL Falcon Radio had its origins as a pirate radio station in a BGSU dorm in the late 1960s. The university soon decided to make it a school-sponsored station and ""WFAL"" officially began broadcasting in 1970.


Over the next 20 years, the station was operated as a carrier current outlet, where a low power transmitter broadcast the signal via the campus telephone system's wiring, accessible on AM/FM radios within residence halls (and occasionally nearby) on the frequency AM 680. It reached its heyday during the mid 1980's following the relocation of the School of Mass Communications from South Hall to West Hall.


In the 1990s, the station became one of the top three college radio stations in the US and was awarded two awards by the National Association of College Broadcasters


In 2008, BGSU increased funding for telecommunications, the station rebuilt the studio to make the station fully digital and add the latest equipment. The transformation included a new name and image and the station was renamed WFAL Falcon Radio. WFAL was previously known as WFAL 1610 AM until 2008 when, after problems with the transmitter being unable to broadcast at a legal range, it was decided for this station to become internet and cable TV only.


The station has gone through a variety of format changes including Top 40, AOR (album-oriented rock). The newest format consists of 5 genres departments: modern rock, Jazz, hip-hop, Talk and Top 40. The station has numerous shows during the day and also carries BGSU and local high school sporting events.",0,19 August 2008, 13 August 2020,60,0,0

The station, which began broadcasting in 1951, is currently owned by Radio Hankook, Inc.  Jean Suh, owner of Radio Hankook, is a pioneer in Korean-language radio programming in the United States.


KSUH broadcasts a mix of Korean language programming to the northern Seattle metropolitan area in a simulcast partnership with sister station KSUH (1450 AM). In addition to South Korean popular music (also known as ""K-pop""), Radio Hankook airs up to six hours of daily talk radio programming, including local and South Korean news, information for recently-arrived immigrants from South Korea, and community affairs.  Other programming includes a program for children in both Korean and English plus a short twice-daily show for all ages that aims to teach basic English language skills.


This station began regular broadcasting on December 1, 1951, with just 100 watts of power on a frequency of 1450 kHz.  Licensed with call sign KAYE, the station was owned and operated by Clarence E. Wilson. By early 1953, KAYE had upgraded to 250 watt operation and Clarence E. Wilson took on P.D. Jackson as a partner in station ownership.


Puyallup Valley Broadcasting Company acquired KAYE from Wilson and Jackson in April 1953.  This proved short-lived as by 1957 the broadcast license had been transferred to Henry Perozzo's Radio Station KAYE, Inc.


The sale by Radio Station KAYE, Inc., to KAYE Broadcasters, Inc., was completed on March 27, 1966. The station continued the country & western music format even after a 1974 change in call sign to KUPY.  KUPY was owned then by local sports legend Bud Blair who was the voice of Puyallup High School sports as well as Pacific Lutheran University.  Radio veteran Bill Glass lists this station as his first radio job.


In July 1978, KAYE Broadcasters, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Shortsleeve Broadcasting, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on July 3, 1978, and the transaction was consummated on October 12, 1978. The station aired a country & western music format with weekly specialty shows, including one in the German language and one on Native American issues.


In October 1981, Shortsleeve Broadcasting, Inc., contracted to sell KUPY to Monroe Enterprises, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on December 11, 1981. The new owners had the Federal Communications Commission change the station's call sign to KJUN on December 23, 1981.


In June 1986, Monroe Enterprises, Inc., announced a deal to sell KJUN to 777 Broadcasting, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on August 15, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on September 5, 1986.


In June 1990, 777 Broadcasting, Inc., agreed to sell this station to Joy Broadcasting, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on August 1, 1990, and the transaction was consummated on October 31, 1990.  In 1992, the station's classic country format was linked up as a network, with stations KJUN-FM, KWYZ in Everett, KENU in Enumclaw, KLDY in Olympia and KBLV in Bellevue simulcasting it. The network would be disbanded in early 1996 due to financial issues, with all stations being put up for sale. Joy Broadcasting bought KJUN, and would continue the classic country format. As part of a rebranding of the station's format as ""The Cowboy"", Joy had the FCC change the station's call sign to KKBY on August 16, 1996.


In February 1997, Joy Broadcasting, Inc., contracted to sell KKBY to Jean J. Suh.  The deal was approved by the FCC on April 4, 1997, and the transaction was finally consummated on August 3, 1999. New owner Jean J. Suh had the FCC change the station's call sign to KSUH after her family name on September 15, 1997.  Suh applied to the FCC in October 2002 to transfer the broadcast license for this station to her company, Radio Hancook, Inc.  The transfer was approved by the FCC on November 15, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on December 1, 2003.


Jean J. Suh worked for five years as an actress as South Korea's Korean Broadcasting System before emigrating to the United States in 1964. While studying at Columbia College Hollywood in 1965, Suh began hosting a 30-minute weekly program of music and news in Korean on a Los Angeles radio station. In 1966 the program was extended to one hour per week and in 1967 to two hours each weekday.  In 1970, Suh and two financial partners launched an independent Korean-language radio station in Los Angeles, the first in the United States.  Suh purchased KKBY (now KSUH) in 1997 and KWYZ (1230 AM) in 1999 to cover the southern and northern halves of the greater Seattle metropolitan area, respectively, as Korean-language ""Radio Hankook"".


Faced with financial difficulties and mounting debts, station owner Jean J. Suh moved KSUH and sister station KWYZ out of their rented studios in a commercial area of Federal Way, Washington, to her private residence in May 2000.  This sparked protests from neighbors, visits from city code enforcement officers, and a public campaign by the station to force the city to allow the studios to remain in Suh's home. Ultimately, the city prevailed in the face of growing community frustration and the stations moved out of the home in late April 2001.


During a series of inspections by agents from the FCC's Seattle office carried out over the period from March 2001 to November 2001, they found that KSUH had failed to ""have operational Emergency Alert System (EAS) equipment"" and ""to conduct required monthly and weekly EAS tests"", failed to ""post the ASR number on or near the base of"" its broadcast tower, and failed to paint or maintain the tower to ensure ""good visibility"" in violation of FCC rules.  After a January 2002 notice of these violations, licensee Jean J. Suh told the FCC that the station had modified its EAS equipment for automatic operation and that she did not own the KSUH tower but was leasing it from the station's previous license holder.  The FCC issued a ""notice of apparent liability"" against Suh for violations by KSUH and sister station KWYZ on August 28, 2002, for a combined total of $22,000. After determining that Suh did not own the KSUH tower, they reduced the penalty to $10,000 in late August 2003.",1,10 April 2009, 14 May 2021,49,0,0

It tells the story of the head for the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management (LAC OEM), which has complete authority in the event of an emergency or natural disaster. He attempts to divert the path of a dangerous lava flow through the streets of Los Angeles following the formation of a volcano at the La Brea Tar Pits.


A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by the film studios of 20th Century Fox, Moritz Original and Shuler Donner/Donner Productions. It was commercially distributed by 20th Century Fox. Volcano explores civil viewpoints, such as awareness, evacuation and crisis prevention. Although the film used extensive special effects, it failed to receive any award nominations from mainstream motion picture organizations for production merits.


Volcano premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on April 25, 1997 grossing $49,323,468 in domestic ticket receipts, on a $90 million budget. It earned an additional $73.5 million in business through international release to top out at a combined $122,823,468 in gross revenue. Despite its release and recognition, Dante's Peak (which was released 2 months before) gained more commercial success than Volcano. It was also met with mixed critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas. The Region 1 code widescreen edition of the film featuring special features was released on DVD in the United States on March 9, 1999.


In downtown Los Angeles, an earthquake strikes. Michael Roark, the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management, insists on coming to work to help out with the crisis, although he has been on vacation with his daughter Kelly. His associate, Emmit Reese, notes that the quake caused no major damage, but seven utility workers are later burned to death in a storm drain at MacArthur Park. One escapes and survives, but is severely burned on one side of his face.


As a precaution, Roark tries to halt the subway lines that run parallel, but Los Angeles MTA Chairman Stan Olber opposes, feeling that there is no threat to the trains. Against regulations, Roark and his coworker Gator Harris venture down the storm sewer in the park to investigate. They barely escape when hot gases suddenly spew out of a crack in the concrete lining and flood the tunnel.


C.I.G.S. geologist Dr. Amy Barnes believes that a volcano may be forming beneath the city with magma flowing underground. Unfortunately, she has insufficient evidence to make Roark take action.


The next day, at around 5:15 A.M., Barnes and her assistant Rachel venture in the storm sewer to investigate the scene of the incident. They discover the crack in the ground that released the gases earlier. While taking samples, a more powerful earthquake strikes and Rachel is killed when she falls into the crack that is later engulfed by a rush of the hot gases. A subway train derails underground and power is knocked out across the city. Minutes later, steam explodes from the sewer system. In the La Brea Tar Pits, volcanic smoke and ash billow out, followed by lava bombs that burst out of the tar pits, which ignite several buildings.


Roark helps injured firefighters out of the area. Moments later, a newly formed underground volcano erupts from the tar pits and lava begins to flow freely down Wilshire Boulevard, incinerating everything in its path, including Roark's GMC Suburban, and an LAFD fire truck overturned by a lava bomb, killing two firefighters inside when it is swept away by the lava flow. Roark and his daughter become separated as she is injured when another lava bomb badly burns her leg and she is taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center by Dr. Jaye Calder.


In the Red Line metro tunnel, the passengers in the derailed subway train are exposed to severe heat and toxic gases, which causes them all to eventually lose consciousness. The train driver tries but fails to open the doors along the length of the train, until reaching the rear where he sees the incoming lava flow in the tunnel hundreds of meters away. Meanwhile, Olber leads his team through the tunnel to the derailed train, searching for survivors. They manage to save everyone, but Olber notices that the train driver is still missing and goes back. He finds the driver alive but unconscious, just as the lava reaches the train and begins to flow underneath it. Olber unsuccessfully attempts to jump the lava, but manages to throw the driver to safety before sinking in and melting.


Roark, Barnes and LAPD police lieutenant Ed Fox, devise a plan to stack concrete barriers at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, creating a cul-de-sac to pool the lava as helicopters dump water on it and all fire fighters open their hoses to form a crust, making the operation a success.


However, Barnes later theorizes that the magma is still flowing underground through the Red Line subway extension, and calculates that the main eruption will occur at the end of the line at the Beverly Center near Cedars-Sinai. To prove this, Barnes and Roark lower a video camera into the tunnel to watch it, only for the camera to be incinerated by a fast-moving flow of lava. They calculate the speed and realize that they have thirty minutes until the lava flows reaches the end of the Red Line.


Through Roark's direction, explosives are used to create channels in the street to divert the flow of lava into Ballona Creek, which will later flow into the Pacific Ocean, but Barnes realizes that the street is sloping in the opposite direction, and instead, the lava would flow directly towards the injured patients. Roark devises another plan to demolish a twenty-two-story condominium building to block the lava's path from flowing towards the medical area and the rest of the Los Angeles West Side. Gator refuses to abandon an LAPD SWAT cop, who has gotten trapped under a fallen ventilation duct while slotting explosive charges when it fell on him due to the tremors.


At that point, the lava reaches the dead end of the subway tunnel extension, and bursts out of the ground in a massive geyser. Gator and the officer sacrifice their lives to detonate the final explosive charge by giving Fox the all-clear to ignite the charges. Roark then spots Kelly nearby, trying to retrieve a small boy who wandered off, putting them in the direct path of the collapsing building. Roark barely manages to save them from being crushed as the building collapses. The plan succeeds, and the lava flows directly into the ocean. Roark escapes from the wreckage with Kelly and the young child still alive. The death toll is nearly a hundred people, thousands injured, and damages in billions.


It starts to rain, with surviving civilians having a sigh a relief. Reese shows up with the family dog Max, along with a call from the police chief on how to rebuild the city. Roark tells Reese that he is on vacation after all, and to tell the chief that too, as he goes home with Kelly while Reese takes over to handle the situation.


The film ends with a view of the volcano and a graphic that reads ""Name: Mount Wilshire. Location: Los Angeles, California. Status: Active."", accompanied by the opening of the Randy Newman song ""I Love L.A.""


Filming was shot primarily on location in Los Angeles, California. Various filming sites included MacArthur Park, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the La Brea Tar Pits.  Extensive special effects surrounding certain aspects of the film such as the lava flow, were created by ten separate digital effects companies including VIFX, Digital Magic Company, Light Matters Inc., Pixel Envy and Anatomorphex. An 80% full-size replica of Wilshire Boulevard, which was one of the largest sets ever constructed in the United States, was assembled in Torrance, California. The computer-generated imagery was coordinated and supervised by Dale Ettema and Mat Beck. Between visuals, miniatures, and animation, over 300 technicians were involved in the production aspects of the special effects.


The score for the film was originally composed and orchestrated by musical conductor Alan Silvestri. Recording artists James Newton Howard and Dillinger among others, contributed songs to the music listing. The audio soundtrack in Compact Disc format featuring 8 tracks, was officially released by the American recording label VarÃ¨se Sarabande on April 22, 1997. The sound effects in the film were supervised by Christopher Boyes. The mixing of the sound elements were orchestrated by Jim Tanenbaum and Dennis Sands.


Among mainstream critics in the US, Volcano received generally mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of 45 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Volcano's prodigious pyrotechnics and Tommy Lee Jones' crotchety sneers at lava aren't quite enough to save this routine disaster film."" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average using critical reviews, the film received a score of 55  out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale. In 1997, the film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award in the category of ""Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property"", but lost to Con Air.


Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ""Volcano begins so excitably and hurtles so quickly into fiery pandemonium,"" but noted that ""in the disaster realm, it's not easy to have it all. A film this technically clever can't get away with patronizing and familiar genre cliches."" Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times called it a ""surprisingly cheesy disaster epic"" while musing, ""The lava keeps flowing for much of the movie, never looking convincing. I loved it when the firemen aimed their hoses way offscreen into the middle of the lava flow, instead of maybe aiming them at the leading edge of the lavaâwhich they couldn't do, because the lava was a visual effect, and not really there."" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote that ""Things go bad after Volcano plays its last card â the lava â and from there it has nothing to show but more of the same. A host of characters is introduced in the opening scenes, but Volcano doesn't know what to do with them. It can't make us care."" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, ""Volcano is cheese, all right, but it's tangy cheese. I'm not sure I've ever seen a disaster movie in which special effects this realistic and accomplished were put to the service of a premise this outlandish."" He declared: ""Volcano is jittery in a clinical, self-important way."" Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Examiner, felt ""Volcano offers a bit of humor, a minimum of plot distraction and the joys of watching molten rock ooze down Wilshire Boulevard."" Left equally impressed was James Berardinelli of ReelViews. Commenting on the character significance of Mike Roark, played by Jones, he said it was ""a wonderfully heroic figure â a man of action who never has time to rest. The fate of the city rests on his shoulders, and he knows it. Jones' fierce, unflagging portrayal helps us accept Roark not only as the man to save L.A., but as a loving father who is more concerned about his daughter's safety than that of every other citizen."" In his summation, he wrote, ""Volcano has opened the ""summer"" movie season at an astoundingly early late-April date. But there's no mistaking this as anything but a blockbuster trying to get a running jump on competition like The Fifth Element and The Lost World. This isn't the kind of film where it's worth waiting for the video tape â it's too big and brash, and demands the speakers and atmosphere of a state-of-the-art theater."" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times added to the positive sentiment by saying the film ""glows with heat. Lava heat. The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.""


Writing for Time Out, author TCh said, ""The most striking aspect of this fun, old-fashioned disaster movie is the novelty of seeing the most familiar of backdrops used as a creative resource in its own right."" He commended how ""Jones and Heche work hard to dig up an emotional rapport from next to nothing"" while also praising how the ""slow but inexorable progress of the lava makes for more suspense than the usual slam bang firework display."" Not entirely impressed was Margaret McGurk writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer. She called the film ""depreciating entertainment value of the natural-disaster trend"" while also mentioning how the ""High-caliber special effects are still fun, but all this lock-step storytelling is wearing thin."" But in a hint of commendation, McGurk thought ""on its own escapist terms, Volcano dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment."" Describing a comical position on seismic activity, Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said Volcano was a ""laughably ridiculous take on what we all secretly dream of: Los Angeles, washed away in a huge, molten tide of cheese â uh, lava, I mean."" Savlov added, ""Screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray have crammed the script with topical references to the L.A. riots, Rodney King, racial inequality, sexism, the ineffectuality of the 911 system, and reams of very, very bad dialogue. So bad, in fact, that the screening audience I viewed Volcano with seemed to enjoy it immensely, hooting and hollering and laughing as though it were an old episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.""


Rita Kempley of The Washington Post, openly wondered why ""there's no volcano in ""Volcano""?...The hokey disaster drama features towering plumes of smoke, a splendid display of fireworks and brimstone, and rivers of molten magma, but I'll be darned if there's a burning mountain."" She concluded her review by declaring that ""While disaster yarns aren't known for subtlety, there are limits, and Volcano giddily goes beyond them. Director Mick Jackson, who also made Steve Martin's wry ""L.A. Story,"" must have had his hands full with the logistics of this bombastic extravaganza. He sets a blistering pace, but the movie never generates any real thrills."" Todd McCarthy of Variety was more positive, writing Volcano delivered ""enough spectacular action to get it off to a hot B.O. start"" and that ""first-time screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray waste no time with exposition or scene-setting, starting the fireworks with a nerve-jangling morning earthquake that puts city workers on alert for possible damage.""

32401299,Operation Combat Fox,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Combat_Fox,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Combat_Fox&action=info,"On 23 January 1968 North Korean patrol boats supported by two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighters captured the USS Pueblo northeast of the North Korean island of Ung-do. The seizure of the Pueblo led to President Lyndon Johnson ordering a show of force with a massive deployment of U.S. air and navy assets to Korea. The airlift and deployment of 200+ aircraft was code named Operation Combat Fox while the deployment of six aircraft carriers plus support vessels was code named Operation Formation Star. The operations were supported by the partial mobilization of reservists for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. CIA A-12 Oxcart reconnaissance overflights over North Korea were used to monitor a feared retaliatory mobilization of North Korean forces and when these flights revealed no mobilization or large scale deployments by North Korean forces, Operation Combat Fox forces were stood down.


Publicly, the Soviet Union responded by augmenting their naval forces in the Pacific and by sending a letter to the US president Lyndon B. Johnson on 3 February 1968 demanding that the United States scale back their build-up in the Sea of Japan. Privately however, Alexei Kosygin gave assurances to the US ambassador in Moscow (Llewellyn Thompson) on 6 February 1968 that the Soviet Union had no intention to go to war over Kim Il Sung's provocation. As a response to this overture, Lyndon Johnson agreed to withdraw one unnamed vessel ""somewhat southward"". This exchange enabled Brezhnev to make a subsequent face-saving statement to the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the Soviet letter was answered by the Americans by withdrawing the USS Enterprise from DPRK's shores.

38760347,Jai Ho Democracy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Ho_Democracy,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jai_Ho_Democracy&action=info,"Jai Ho! Democracy, is a 2015 Indian comedy film written and directed by Ranjit Kapoor, who was also the dialogue writer of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and has been produced by Bikramjeet Bhullar of Indian Production House. It is a dark satire on Indian politics and takes a dig at the existing social and political morass India is staring at currently. It stars an ensemble cast that includes the likes of Om Puri, Annu Kapoor, Satish Kaushik, Adil Hussain and Seema Biswas.


The film's trailer was released on 18 March 2015. and is scheduled to release on 24 April 2015. It is about the murky world of India's political class, where ministers and leaders procrastinate over everything, even on something as grave as border security. Jai Ho! Democracy also takes a satirical look at the media's desperation to stay ahead in the TRP game, sensationalizing even the most trivial situation without any qualms.


A freak incident in an Indian camp along the LoC triggers a war of words with their Pakistani counterparts on the other side of the no-manâs land. News of this standoff between the two camps gets leaked to a super-enthu news reporter and in no time, news spreads on national television that India and Pakistan are on the brink of a war.


This sensational disclosure, with no concrete evidence whatsoever, takes both the public and the government by surprise. The international bodies are alarmed, too. The Home Minister, in a bid to buy time, sets up a committee meeting to discuss the situation, submitting that they will decide whether India should go for war or not.


Chaired by an ex-Supreme Court Judge, the committee consists of members from the parliament, ex-servicemen and NGO workers. What follows is a series of hilarious events in the committee meeting, where the members, relying on silly excuses of so-called parliamentary rules and etiquette, go full throttle to tear each other apart. Within no time, the actual matter for discussion is lost in the chaos and they indulge in unbelievably petty and personal ego clashes. All thisâ¦ even as the army, the government, the public and the world bodies wait with bated breath for their decisions. Till finally, the venue of the committee meeting turns into a battlefield, with the members going for each otherâs throats.


The film takes a comic look at the way the powers-that-be love to procrastinate and maintain status quo, unfazed by the gravity of situations at hand. It explores the hilarity of the levels to which the media can go to sensationalize issues. It also gives a message of hope to peace through a glimpse of a Utopian possibility, albeit momentary, between the armies of the two neighboring nations.


Ranjit Kapoor, the writer of cult classic of 1983 - Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, and Bikramjeet Singh Bhullar decided to revisit the satirical genre with Jai Ho! Democracy, a satirical comedy reflecting the current state of political and social affairs in India. Ranjit Kapoor and his team which has Sreekanth Agneeaswaran and Bikramjeet Bhullar, had been working on this idea for two years. Their intent was to make a wholesome comedy that people could watch repeatedly, which would also serve as a mirror for our society.


Ranjit kapoor wanted to take up the challenge of showcasing good cinema without the hoopla of mega star-casts, item songs or big budgets. He chose to cast seasoned actors like Om Puri, Annu Kapoor, Satish Kaushik, Seema Biswas, Adil Hussain, Dolly Ahluwalia, and many others, who have left a mark in Indian cinema and theatre with their beyond comparison acting. The film was shot in two schedules, one in Mumbai and the other in Sri Ganganagar.  The film got completed in a record 28 days. Ranjit Kapoor credited his son-in-law Bikramjeet Singh, who is the co-writer, co-director and producer, with the creative process and detailing of the film.


The movie with a runtime of 85 minutes received U/A Censor Certificate. The film will hit the theatres on 24 April 2015.


In one of the interviews when Ranjit Kapoor was asked about his preference between Theatre and Film, he mentioned that he refrains from working for films because distribution companies and financers usually abstain from unique concepts and stick with commercial cinema. This hinders a lot of thought provoking cinema and great acting from reaching the audiences. In comparison, theatre gives a platform to quench the thirst of delivering unique matter to niche audience which appreciates distinctive story-lines.


Vishal Thakur of the Hindi daily Hindustan wrote that the film did not match Ranjeet Kapoor's temperament and writing.


The music for Jai Ho! Democracy is composed by Ray N Brotherhood and includes 3 tracks. The lyrics have been done by Yash Bhardwaj and Sreekanth Agneeaswaran. Sound design has been done by Hitesh Chaurasia.


The Central Board of Film Certification required the removal of certain scenes of the film which involved usage of certain abusive phrases. The film was submitted again for approval after making required edits, post which it received U/A certification. However, some members of the cast remained dissatisfied. Annu Kapoor, actor and brother of Ranjit Kapoor, who is playing the character of Ramalingam in the film, termed it as curbing of freedom of expression. He stated that the character portrayal justified those scenes akin to usage of any abusive language in a scene involving slum residents or item songs in commercial cinema. Unlike Annu Kapoor, Om Puri, who plays the role of Pandeyji, stated that abusive language should not be allowed in films and that the success of a film is independent of abuses.


Questioning the definition of mainstream cinema, Om Puri stated that though this is an independent film with lot of heart and passion. it is as mainstream as the other films with a full package of entertainment and comedy but without the KHANS.",1,9 March 2013, 12 June 2021,63,0,0

He was also a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Alabama in the 2010 election. After losing in the primary, he moved to Virginia and joined the Republican Party. He rejoined the Democratic Party 2015 and 2017 in his two attempts to be elected Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama in the 2015 and 2019 elections, losing both times. He rejoined the Republican Party for one year in 2016.


Davis was an early supporter of Barack Obama's 2008 bid for the presidency, and one of the national co-chairs for Obama's 2008 campaign. Known for his oratorical skills, Davis made one of the nominating speeches for Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. While serving on the House Ways and Means Committee, Davis was the first African-American member of Congress to advocate that Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel give up the chairmanship of the tax committee in the wake of ethics charges against Rangel. In 2009 and 2010 Davis, voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to do so.


In 2009, Davis sought to become Alabama's first African-American Governor. In attempting to appeal to a broader electorate, he lost the support of black voters by opposing national health care reform and failing to meet with certain black political groups. He lost in the Democratic primary to Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks, a more liberal Democrat.


Shortly after, Davis announced he would not be running for re-election to the House in 2010, instead returning to the practice of law. He subsequently moved to Virginia and joined the Republican Party. A 1990s honors graduate of Harvard University, in 2012 Davis became a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. He also began writing a column for the conservative National Review. He considered running for Congress as a Republican in the 2014 House elections in Virginia but did not do so. A resident of Virginia from 2011 until 2014, Davis spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention in support of the Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney. He was defeated in his two attempts to be elected Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama in the 2015 and 2019 mayoral elections.


Davis was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on October 9, 1967, and was raised by his mother and grandmother. He graduated from Jefferson Davis High School and then magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1990. He earned a J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law School before returning to Alabama. He was the recipient of the Best Oralist Award in the Ames Moot Court Competition at Harvard Law School.


After working as an intern at the Southern Poverty Law Center and then as a civil rights lawyer, he served as an Assistant United States Attorney.


Davis ran for the House in the Democratic primary against 10-year incumbent and former civil rights activist, Earl F. Hilliard. He criticized Hilliard for taking a trip to Libya in 1997 despite U.S. sanctions. Davis lost the 2000 primary election 58%â34%.


Davis ran again in 2002. The race attracted national attention because both candidates made the Israeli-Palestinian conflict an issue, and both attracted support and money from outside of AlabamaâDavis from Jewish Americans and supporters of Israel, Hilliard from Arab-Americans and supporters of the Palestinians. During the campaign, Hilliard questioned whether Davis was ""black enough"" to represent the district.  Davis narrowly won the primary requiring a runoff in June. He won the runoff easily, assuring him  victory in November in the heavily Democratic district, and he began his term in January 2003.


Davis was challenged in the 2004 primary by Albert Turner Jr., a son of a leader of Selma's ""Bloody Sunday"" march. Davis won the primary 88%â12%.


In the Democratic primary, he defeated political newcomer Eddison Walters 90%â9%. He won the general election unopposed.


In the new Democratically controlled 110th Congress, Davis was assigned to the Committee on Ways and Means. The stature of that appointment, and the difficulty of raising sufficient funds, led Davis to postpone plans to challenge conservative Senator Jeff Sessions in 2008. In January 2007, Davis said that he was still interested in running on a statewide ticket in 2010, either for Governor, or for Senate if Richard Shelby elected to retire.


In 2007 he became the first Congressman outside Illinois to endorse Senator Barack Obama for president in 2008.  At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Davis gave a seconding speech formally placing Obama's name in nomination.  Davis also served as one of Obama's national campaign co-chairs.


Davis's name surfaced in media speculation as a potential Attorney General in Obama's cabinet.  However, Davis was quoted in The Birmingham News as stating that he did not anticipate such an offer, and would refuse it if made.


As a freshman in Congress, Davis led the successful fight to reverse funding cuts for minority land grant colleges including Tuskegee University.  As a second term member, Davis won a floor fight to restore funding to the HOPE VI program for renovating public housing; he persuaded over sixty Republicans to vote with Democrats. In 2005, Davis was the lead Democratic sponsor of a bill establishing a national cord blood bank which will widen the availability of blood transfusions for thousands of patients who suffer from diseases such as sickle cell anemia and diabetes. He received an Aâ grade on his voting record relating to veteran issues from Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.


Davis was appointed to the Senior Whip Team for the Democratic Caucus of the 109th Congress and was the co-chair of the centrist House New Democrat Coalition, as well as the Southern Regional co-chair for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.


Davis was the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to demand that former House Ways and Means chair Charlie Rangel surrender his gavel in the wake of an ongoing ethics investigation.


Davis twice voted against the Democratic-supported health care reform legislation, first in November 2009, and again in March 2010 when the legislation passed and was signed into law by President Obama. He was the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against the legislation in March 2010;  he was also the member from the most-heavily Democratic-leaning district to vote against the legislation.


In April 2009, Davis voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.


In Congress, Davis was a member of the  Committee on Ways and Means, the Committee on the Judiciary and several of their subcommittees. He was a member of the 30 Something Working Group and the Congressional Black Caucus.


On February 6, 2009, Davis announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in 2010. His opponent in the Democratic primary was Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks.


During the primary campaign, Davis downplayed matters of race and emphasized his independence from Democratic party orthodoxy. He caused controversy, including within his heavily minority congressional district, by voting against President Barack Obama's new health-care lawâthe only black Democrat in Congress to do so. He also refused to sit for the endorsement screenings of Alabama's black political groups, drawing criticism that he was snubbing African Americans in order to court white votes. Davis lost the Democratic primary to Sparks on June 1, 2010, ending his gubernatorial bid. Birmingham News columnist John Archibald questioned Davis' strategy, saying that he campaigned ""as it if were a general election and he wanted to claim some conservative street cred."" Archibald believed that this hurt him with Democratic primary voters in Alabama, who are ""blue dots in this big red state,"" and resulted in him becoming ""the first African-American candidate in a statewide Alabama race to lose the black vote."" After the primary, State Representative Roderick Scott said black Democrats âcan no longer take for granted they will receive the African-American vote.â Davis announced he was retiring from politics and would return to private practice at the conclusion of his term in Congress in 2011. Davis was succeeded by Democrat Terri Sewell, the first African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives from Alabama.


For a time, Davis was doubtful he would run for public office again. He said, ""Alabama is not friendly to independent candidaciesâ and suggested that running as a Republican would not be a viable option because the Alabama Republican Party had declined to embrace politicians who have switched parties such as former U.S. Congressman Parker Griffith who switched parties and lost the Republican primary in 2010. He changed his voter registration from Alabama to Virginia in 2012, and said he would run as a Republican were he to seek political office in the future.


In the Spring of 2012, he announced he would become a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. In 2012, the conservative National Review online started publishing some of his political commentary. In February 2012, Davis told Politico that some Democrats wanted to argue that Obama's critics were motivated by racism, which Davis called ""a huge mistake ... a tactic that's likely to backfire"" as it would lead ""substantial number of Americans"" to believe they were being called racists because they did not support Obama.


In August 2012, he cited remarks by Vice President Joe Biden for ""racial viciousness"" for remarks Davis said were insulting to African Americans, and said, ""Governor Romney is absolutely right as the Obama campaign is running a divisive campaign â¦ pitting one set of Americans against another issue after issue"". Davis also said, ""It wouldn't be so bad if Barack Obama had not campaigned in such a different way."" Davis spoke at the Republican National Convention in August 2012 to voice additional criticisms of Barack Obama. Following Mitt Romney's loss in the 2012 presidential election, Davis said: ""The Republican conservative base seems perilously close to shrinking to white southern evangelicals, senior white males, and upper income Protestants.""


In December 2013, it was announced that Davis would not run for retiring Republican Congressman Frank Wolf's seat in Virginia. Davis had previously expressed interest in running for Wolf's seat after his move to the state.


In late June 2014, it was reported that Davis was considering running for Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama in 2015. On July 18, 2014, Davis announced that he would launch an exploratory campaign for a mayoral run. On January 22, 2015, he officially declared his candidacy as a Democrat. On August 25, 2015, Artur Davis was defeated in the mayoral election by incumbent mayor Todd Strange. Following this loss, Davis expressed interest in running for the Montgomery County Commission in 2016 as a Democrat. However, the Alabama Democratic Party refused to allow Davis on the ballot, as he had supported a Republican candidate for office within the past four years.


Davis was also a candidate for Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama in the August 2019 mayoral election, but lost again, winning 11,010 votes and sixth place in a multi-way race.",3,19 December 2003, 19 September 2021,539,1,1
8707439,Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_Lion_Reintroduction_Project,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asiatic_Lion_Reintroduction_Project&action=info,"The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project is an initiative of the Indian Government to provide safeguards to the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo leo)[a] from extinction in the wild by means of reintroduction. The last wild population of the Asiatic lion is found in the region of Gir Forest National Park, in the state of Gujarat. The single population faces the threats of epidemics, natural disasters and other anthropogenic factors. The project aims to establish a second independent population of Asiatic lions at the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. However, the proposed translocation has been bitterly contested by the state government.


The distribution of Asiatic lion, once found widely in West and South Asia, dwindled to a single population in the Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in India. The population at Gir declined to 18 animals in 1893 but increased due to protection and conservation efforts to 284 in 1994. The Gir Wildlife Sanctuary is now highly overpopulated with lions, the 2015 census showed the strength to be 523 lions.  There are numerous deaths in the population annually because of ever increasing competition between the human and animal overcrowding. Asiatic lion prides require large territories but there is limited space at Gir wildlife sanctuary, which is boxed in on all sides by heavy human habitation. Gir lions have started moving outwards from the sanctuary and establishing homes outside the protected areas. The lions are now spread over 16,000 square kilometres (6,200Â sqÂ mi) in the vicinity of 1050 villages in three contiguous districts - Amreli, Bhavnagar and Junagadh.


The Maharaja of Gwalior, on being encouraged by Lord Curzon in 1904, imported cubs of African lions and attempted to introduce them in the wild in the forests near Sheopur. The introduced lions took to raiding livestock and some even turned to man-eating, subsequent to which they were all eventually tracked down and shot.


The concept of reintroduction for purposes of conservation was accepted in 1956 by the Indian Wildlife Board during a meeting of their executive committee at Sasan Gir and the offer by the state government of Uttar Pradesh to host a second population in the Chakia forests was accepted. In 1956 one lion and two lionesses were captured from Gir, placed in the Sakkarbuagh Zoo in Junagadh for nine months and then translocated in 1957 to the 96 square kilometres (37Â sqÂ mi) Chandra Prabha Sanctuary,  near Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and newly established for the reintroduction. An enclosure was created with a 3 metres (9.8Â ft) high barbed wire fence within the sanctuary in which the lions were temporarily housed before being released in the sanctuary. Initially the lions prospered increasing in number to four in 1958, five in 1960, seven in 1962 and eleven in 1965 after which the population died out inexplicably.


Johnsingh (2006) attributes the failure of the translocation to three causes â inadequate area, lack of systematic monitoring using scientific techniques and unrestricted movement of grazing animals throughout the sanctuary possibly leading to conflict with herders. Small size of area, the long period of captivity in Junagadh zoo, absence of education of the local villagers and lack of conflict resolution mechanisms are also listed as contributory factors in Chellam and Johnsingh (1999).


The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) began studying the Asiatic lion in its habitat in from 1986 onwards and collected fundamental data about the lion, its feeding, use of habitat and ranging habits. Key findings of the study were that the lions largely preyed upon wild herbivores such as sambar (Rusa unicolor) and chital (Axis axis) and that the size of home range was 70 square kilometres (27Â sqÂ mi) for females and 140 square kilometres (54Â sqÂ mi) for the males. In 1990, the WII proposed the creation of a second wild population of Asiatic lions to safeguard the species against potential calamities in Gujarat's Gir National Park.


In 1993, a workshop was held on the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) of Asiatic lion and the report was presented to the state forest departments in Vadodara, Gujarat. State forest departments were asked to suggest suitable sites for reintroduction and provide the basic ecological data.


During the workshop, a number of teams were formed to focus on varied aspects of the conservation biology of the Asiatic lion such as monitoring, habitat (further subdivided into Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan sub-groups), population modelling, prey-base requirements, lion-human interactions, translocation, captive zoo animals, public education, veterinary, reproductive and genetic aspects etc.


The sites were assessed and ranked for suitability as follows:


The PHVA report strongly favoured the scientific management of reintroduction of Asiatic lions to another site:


The overwhelming consensus of the Workshop was that an alternative habitat for the Asiatic lion must be established with all possible speed, but without compromise of the accepted strategies and principles governing systematic and scientific reintroduction. This should be done simultaneously with strengthening effective protection and management of the Gir Forest and assuring the viability of the captive population and alternative genetic resources.

The PHVA deliberations were followed by visits to the three most promising site, viz Kuno, Darrah-Jawaharsagar and Sitamata WLS by a survey team of WII headed by Dr Ravi Chellam. The team evaluated sites over various parameters and compared the same with respect to Gir Forest for determining the suitability of sites. They presented their findings in 1995 to the Government of India and the state forest departments. WII researchers confirmed that the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary was the most promising location to re-establish a free ranging population of the Asiatic lions and in 2007 certified it ready to receive its first batch of translocated lions.


The framework of the Lion Introduction Project emerged from the transformation of a Monitoring Committee, set up by the Government of India, which met on 10 March 2004 for effective implementation of the reintroduction at Kuno.


At the meeting the WII Site Survey was examined and it was understood that Kuno Palpur Sanctuary was the most suitable site for reintroduction. The Committee formulated a three phase framework for the conservation project to last for two decades as followsÂ :


At that point in time, the project was in Phase II and 18 of the 24 villages had been rehabilitated from Kuno. The refusal of Gujarat state to provide lions was mentioned during this meeting by the Chief Wildlife Warden of Gujarat. A number of steps were approved with consensus which included the engaging of the Gujarat State Government as to the necessity of the project, preparation of a trans-location road map, fresh assessment of prey base of Kuno by WII and continued funding support for welfare measures and habitat improvement for the existing fauna at Kuno.


The Madhya Pradesh state forest department notified 345 square kilometres (133Â sqÂ mi) of the Kuno Palpur area as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1981. In April 2002, a separate Wildlife Division was established for Kuno, effectively increasing the protected area for wildlife to 1,268.861 square kilometres (489.910Â sqÂ mi).


Twenty four villages of the Sahariya tribe, comprising 1545 families, were moved out from the core area and rehabilitated by the state government with assistance from the Central Government. Due to a paucity of suitable revenue lands in the vicinity of Kuno, the state government proposed relocating the villages on degraded protected forests, a move approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) of the Government of India, which granted its approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 for diversion of 3,395.9 hectares (8,391 acres). By 2002-2003, all 24 villages and the identified families were relocated outside Kuno and the former village area converted into grasslands.


The Madhya Pradesh state government informed the Supreme Court that each family was given 2 hectares (4.9 acres) of cultivable land, in addition to 500 square metres (600Â sqÂ yd) for housing along with building constructional material costing Rs 1,00,000/- per house. The net outflow to the Central Government was Rs.15 crores.


Major gaps remain in the implementation of the rehabilitation measures, with villagers alleging that they have got little of the rehabilitation package they were promised. The negative economic impact of the displacement to villagers from Kuno sanctuary has raised a controversy over the merits of species preservation via dislocation of human populations living inside Protected Areas. NGOs, such as the Samrakshan Trust, have been working for better rehabilitation of villagers who agreed to move out of the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary.


In 2004, the state government refused to part with the first pride of 19 animals planned for relocation. The state considers the lions as ""heritage of the state"" and the issue of handing over lions has become a political issue.  Mangubhai Patel, then State Forest Minister, went on record to state that:


There is no need to shift lions from Gir. We will ensure their survival here.

As early as 2009, the continued opposition of the Gujarat state government led to the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department's exploration of the possibility of procuring zoo-bred Asiatic lions and shifting them and their descendants to Palpur-Kuno.


The Gujarat state government has, over time, made various arguments against translocating lions to Madhya Pradesh (MP), such as that the Kuno sanctuary was not suitable lion habitat and that it had inadequate prey base, that MP had been unable to provide adequate protection to tigers in its Panna National Park and the lions if reintroduced there would be in danger, that the proposed introduction of Southern African cheetahs to Kuno rendered it unsuitable for lion reintroduction.


The Gujarat State Wildlife Department proposed new homes for lions in the Barda Wildlife Sanctuary and Bhavnagar Amreli Forest instead. Gir's lions have spread beyond the protective area and the measures of the state to engage this phenomenon are being portrayed as providing adequate dispersal to the lion population to prevent disease. Gujarat also played an emotional card by declaring before the Supreme Court that the lion was inextricably bound to the culture of Gujarat and that it was a ""family member"", hence could not be provided for translocation to Kuno.


This stand of Gujarat suffered a setback when on 15 April 2013, the Supreme Court of India acknowledged translocation to Kuno as being in the best interest of the species and rejected the Gujarat Government's objections, instead ordering the translocation to be carried out within six months.  A bandh was called in the villages adjoining the Sasan Gir region on 18 April 2013 protesting the Supreme Court decision.


In light of the State Government of Gujarat's refusal to permit the reintroduction of Asiatic lions, a writ petition was filed in 1995 by the Centre for Environment Law and WWF-I in the Indian Supreme Court to get the Gujarat State Government to release a few prides of Asiatic lions for the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary. The Indian Supreme Court fast-tracked the case and delivered a judgement on 16 April 2013 permitting the reintroduction of lions to Kuno, over-ruling the objections of the Gujarat Government.


The Gujarat Government filed on 1 July 2013 for a review in the Supreme Court of its 16 April ruling. In its petition, the Gujarat state government claimed that ""top carnivores have never been successfully translocated"".
The state has put forward the argument that translocation would break social bonds between members of groups or prides, which are vital for lion survival. The reported presence of tiger cubs in Palpur-Kuno was emphasised, saying that it could result in conflict between these top predators. The state proposed, instead, a second home for lions within Gujarat itself, claiming it would have numerous advantages including being in tune with international guidelines. 
The continued reluctance of the state to part with lions for translocation has come under criticism from prominent environmentalists.


Post the verdict, fears have been voiced by Gujarati environmentalists over the gun culture of Madhya Pradesh and number of firearms in Sheopur, the region where the Kuno Palpur sanctuary is located and it is suggested that translocation to such an area would be in violation of IUCN norms on the subject. With the release of IUCN guidelines on translocation, opponents of the project have cited from the provisions and also claimed that the history of translocations especially in India is dismal and hence translocation is not favoured. The natural spread of over-populated lions from an original range of over 1,412 square kilometres (545Â sqÂ mi) to an area extending over 10,500 square kilometres (4,100Â sqÂ mi), is considered to mitigate against the risk of epidemic disease.


The Gujarat government's curative petition against relocation of the wild Asiatic lions from the Gir Forest to Madhya Pradesh was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 14 August 2014.


In the face of continued opposition, the Madhya Pradesh government is considering an alternate plan to release zoo-bred lions from Hyderabad and Sakkarbaug, a move which has been criticised in the light of the deaths of two newly translocated zoo-bred lions in the safari park at Etawah, Uttar Pradesh.


After the dismissal of the Gujarat State petition, two NGOs from Gujarat have filed separate petitions against the translocation order, one on the grounds that certain relevant facts have not been brought to the notice of the apex court, the other stating that the importance of Kuno-Palpur as a corridor for migrating tigers between Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan and Madhav National Park in Madhya Prdesh had been downplayed.


As of December 2017, Madhya Pradesh still has not received lions from Gujarat. For this reason, it may have given up on trying to acquire them.


As of October 2018, the lions were still in Gujarat, and 23 of them were found dead. 4 of them had died of canine distemper virus, which killed 1,000 East African lions in the Serengeti ecoregion.


The plan is to reintroduce a pride or two of wild, free-ranging Asiatic lions from Gir Forest in the neighboring Indian state of Gujarat to start with.


In compliance with the Supreme Court order of 15 April 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests has constituted a panel for deciding the best course of action in translocation of animals to Gir. The panel comprises 12 members including member secretary National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Chief Wildlife Wardens of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, member Wildlife Institute of India, and scientists Drs Ravi Chellam, Y.V. Jhala, NK Ranjeet Singh and PR Sinha. The panel will advice both the states on technical aspect of translocation, decide the composition of animals to be translocated, select the prides and animals, supervise the translocation, monitor it and periodically report to the Ministry. During the first deliberations on 29 July 2013, the panel acceded the need to follow the recent IUCN translocation guidelines but brushed aside Gujarat's objections against the process. A two-member team comprising Dr Ravi Chellam and Dr Y.V. Jhala has been set up to decide the translocation protocol and report within six weeks.


Gujarat objected to meeting of the 12-member panel on 29 July 2013 before its petition had been reviewed and also to the presence of tiger experts on the panel, claiming that lion experts from Gujarat had been ignored, however that petition was rejected by the Supreme Court.


In a further development, in April 2015, the Union government has admitted that Madhya Pradesh will have to enlarge the wildlife sanctuary's size, from 349 square kilometres (135Â sqÂ mi) to 700 square kilometres (270Â sqÂ mi) in order to implement the translocation of the Asiatic lions to Kuno-Palpur from Gujarat's Sasan Gir, a suggestion made in the original project report. This is the first time that the Government of India has accepted that the sanctuary needs to be enlarged. However, the expansion would require the relocation of several big villages, a move the Madhya Pradesh government is not keen to undertake. The Madhya Pradesh Forest Department is of the view that the present sanctuary area and its buffer total over 700Â km2 and are therefore adequate, but have made no mention of notifying the buffer zone area also as a sanctuary.


In a reversal of position, the Ministry of Environment and Forests decided in a meeting in June 2015 against translocation at present on the grounds that it would be detrimental to the breeding and survival of the lions as they lived in social prides. The turn-around of stance has been attributed by environmentalists supporting the translocation to Narendra Modi who had as Chief Minister of Gujarat stated that the lion was the pride of Gujarat and had publicly declared his opposition to the transfer of lions outside the state.",1,1 January 2007, 20 August 2021,431,0,0

Rubens was born in Antwerp to an old merchant family. He was trained as a scholar and travelled to Italy where he received his diploma in Canon law in Rome in 1550. He returned north in 1557 and set up his practise in Antwerp where he married Maria Pypelinckx in 1558. On 7 May 1562 he became magistrate of Antwerp and served until 1568, when he fled to Cologne with his family, probably to avoid the Council of Troubles. His position and that of his fellow magistrates became precarious when the Duke of Alva came north to suppress the rebellion after the Beeldenstorm.
Johann VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg.


In Cologne he could renew his work as a lawyer, because there were many Dutch refugees there who wanted to recover seized property they had left behind. He began to work as an advisor to Anna of Saxony and they had an affair at her home in Siegen. By the time it was discovered, she was pregnant and Rubens was arrested during a trip he took to Siegen to visit her and he was locked up in the Nassau family's castle at Dillenburg in March, 1571. His wife, who knew nothing of the affair, came to support him after he wrote to tell her he feared he would be executed. She supported him throughout his imprisonment. Thanks to her letters, Rubens was allowed to join his family in Siegen on condition of payment of 6,000 daalders bail, but he was not allowed out of Siegen or do any business work until the death of Anna of Saxony in Dresden on 18 December 1577. His illegitimate daughter with Anna of Saxony, Christina van Diez, was born 22 August 1571. In 1574 his first son with Maria Pypelinckx, Philip Rubens was born. Three years later, in 1577 Peter Paul Rubens was born.

He was best known for his world record setting opening partnership of 413 runs with Pankaj Roy in 1956, a record that stood for 52 years, and for running out a batsman ""backing up"" at the non-striker's end. Mankading in cricket is named after him. In June 2021, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.


An opening batsman and slow left arm orthodox bowler, he played in 44 Tests for India, and made 2109 runs at an average of 31.47 including five Test centuries with a top score of 231. He also took 162 wickets at an average of 32.32, including eight five-wicket hauls. He is one of three cricketers to have batted in every position during his Test career. He was the first Indian to score 1000 test runs and to take 100 test wickets. He also completed the double of 1000 test runs and 100 test wickets in just 23 test matches which was a then world record stood nearly for quarter of a century before being surpassed by Ian Botham.


His son Ashok Mankad also played Test cricket for India. Rahul Mankad, another son, played first-class cricket.


Mankad was included in the India squad that toured England in 1946. Leading up to the First Test of the three-match series, he had played 11 first-class games on the tour averaging 20.9 with the bat and 14.2 with the ball, having picked 44 wickets, the best for India thus far as a bowler. He made his debut at the Lord's opening the batting for India before being bowled out for 14 by England spinner Doug Wright. After ""long spells of bowling"" in England's first innings, Mankad top-scored for his team with 67 in the second innings. India went on to lose the match by ten wickets. However, Wisden wrote in praise of Mankad calling him a ""valuable all-round player"" alongside teammates Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare. Former England Test cricketer Patsy Hendren rated Mankad as India's ""best all-rounder"". In the Second Test in Manchester, Mankad claimed a five-wicket haul in England's first innings. He contributed 42 with the bat and picked two wickets in a drawn cause in the final Test at the Oval. Mankad completed the tour with a double of a thousand runs and hundred wickets, the first tourist to achieve the feat since Learie Constantine of the West Indies in 1928. He finished with 1,120 runs at 28.00 and 129 wickets at 20.76 apiece. John Arlott wrote of him: ""From his first over in England, Mankad was a good slow left-hander. By the end of the tour, there is little doubt that he was the best slow left-arm bowler in the world."" Wisden chose him as one of its five Cricketers of the Year.


Mankad's 1947â48 Australia tour began on a positive note after he claimed a five-wicket haul in the first match in Western Australia's first innings. He picked four wickets in the second game against South Australia including that of Don Bradman, while making an unbeaten 116 with the bat. Against Cricket Australia XI, he returned figures of 8/84 in the final innings helping his team win by 47 runs. He had a poor start to the Test series, and was dismissed by Australia's pacer Ray Lindwall for 0 and 7 at Brisbane, and 5 and 5 at Sydney. Mankad subsequently modified his back-lift of the bat from high to low for the remainder of the series after being advised by Lindwall himself and went on to score centuries at the Third and Fifth Tests in Melbourne. In reply to Australia's 394 in the Third Test, Mankad put on 124 runs for the first wicket with Chandu Sarwate, and reached his debut century in 139 minutes in the first innings. After a first innings score of 49 in Adelaide, Mankad scored 111 in the last Test in Melbourne, his making his second century of the series. Batting for five hours, he added 124 runs with Hemu Adhikari for the second wicket. However, India went on to lose the match and the series, 4â0. Mankad finished the tour with 889 first-class runs at 38.65 which included a total of three centuries, while claiming 61 wickets with the ball, the most for India.


Mankad's best performance was against England at Lord's in 1952. In the first innings, he top-scored with 72. During England's first innings, he bowled 73 overs and took 5 wickets for 196 runs. In India's second innings in that Test match, he top-scored again with 184 runs out of India's total of 378. Though England won the game easily, Mankad's all-around performance salvaged India's pride in a series where they were heavily outmatched. Mankad was the first player in more than 30 years to score a 100 and take five wickets in the same Test and the first Indian to achieve this feat. As such, he is one of only three non-England 'away' players whose names appear on both batting and bowling honours boards at Lords. (The other two are Keith Miller and Sir Gary Sobers).


Also memorable was his role earlier in the same year against England in Madras. He took 8/52 in England's first innings and 4/53 in the second helping India beat England for the first time in a Test match.


In 1956 he hit 231 against New Zealand at Chennai and together with Pankaj Roy established the then world record opening partnership of 413 runs which stood for 52 years. His score was a Test record for India at the time and would remain so until it was broken in 1983 by Sunil Gavaskar.


Playing for Tonge in the Bolton Cricket League, Mankad picked up 54 wickets in the 1961 season, becoming the first player to claim more than 50 wickets in a season in the league.


Mankad caused a major controversy in 1947/48 on India's tour of Australia when he ran out Bill Brown in the second Test. Mankad, bowling, paused during the delivery stride of his run-up and broke the wicket at the non-striker's end, whilst Brown was out of his crease backing up the striker in the accepted manner. He had done the same thing to Brown in the game against an Australian XI earlier on the tour, but his running out of Brown infuriated the Australian media, and running someone out in this way is now referred to around the world as ""Mankading"". Although such an act is not an infringement of the laws of cricket, to some it is considered unsporting and against the spirit of the game.


However, famed cricketer Sir Don Bradman in his autobiography defended Mankad's action, saying:


While perfectly legal, some contend that by convention, a bowler should at least warn a batsman who persists in backing up too far before dismissing him in that fashion. Mankad himself had warned Brown before dismissing him in this fashion in the earlier game. Courtney Walsh likewise received praise for warning rather than dismissing Saleem Jaffar, who was backing up during the 1987 World Cup.


The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1973.


A road named in honor of Mankad is situated just south of the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.


A statue in his memory is present in his birth town of Jamnagar, Gujarat.

Asian chestnuts (Castanea crenata, C. mollissima) as well as European chestnuts (C. sativa) can be used.


In China, chÇolÃ¬zi (çæ å­; ""stir-fried chestnut"") is a popular autumn street food. Because they are roasted with sand and sweet syrup, they are also called tÃ¡ngchÇolÃ¬zi (ç³çæ å­; ""sugar stir-fried chestnut"").


Gunbam (êµ°ë°¤; ""roasted chestnut"") is a popular street food in both North and South Korea. The food is sold from late autumn to winter by the vendors wearing ushanka, which is sometimes referred to as ""roasted chestnut vendor hat"" or ""roasted sweet potato vendor hat"". A popular folk song called Gunbam taryeong (êµ°ë°¤íë ¹; ""ballad of roasted chestnuts"") was composed by Jeon Su-rin in 1932, and has been sung since, being one of the songs commonly taught in public schools in South Korea.


Roasted chestnuts are popular street food in Portugal. Called castanhas assadas (""roasted chestnuts"") in Portuguese, it is sold around November, when Dia de SÃ£o Martinho (St. Martin's Day) is celebrated across the country. Traditionally, newly harvested chestnuts are eaten around a bonfire on this day.


Roasted chestnuts are sold as street food primarily in Manhattan. Though they've been sold regularly for well over a century, the major consumers are primarily tourists, not residents. Once common, they've become less so. They're sold ($3-$4 a bag) starting either at the beginning of autumn, or when the first chill sets in â about the end of September, or early October, until early spring. The few vendors who currently sell them say they mostly sell to tourists around the Christmas holidays.

Khan began on the competitive StarCraft: Brood War at the age of 13. Other StarCraft professionals include fellow Team PokerStars member Bertrand Grospellier. Khan is also known within the Marvel vs Capcom 2 community.


Khan's nickname ""RaiNKhaN"" was adapted, along with his last name, from the Mortal Kombat character ""Rain,"" who serves as an assassin for Shao Kahn in the series. Khan dropped out from SUNY Albany in order to concentrate on playing poker professionally. Khan is known to multi-table many online tournaments, so much so that he had a friend of his film him for a YouTube video in which he played 26 sit-and-go tournaments simultaneously on a single computer monitor to prove that he wasn't a Pokerbot. On March 23, 2008, Khan won the PokerStars Sunday Warm-up, a weekly $215 buy-in tournament in which he outlasted a field of 2,504 players in more than 9 hours of play earning $97,856. 



At the 2007 World Series of Poker Main Event Khan finished in sixth place earning $956,243. He also finished in the money during two other WSOP events.

The priory was founded circa 1146 by William de Albini and his wife Queen Adeliza (widow of King Henry I). The foundation charter endowed the priory with the site of the old Buckenham castle and the rectories of All Saints and St. Andrews in the manor of Buckenham. The priory was dedicated to St Mary, St James, and All Saints, and the canons were to follow the rule of the order of St Augustine.


Following further donations of land and other benefactions the abbey, by 1291, held property in 42 Norfolk parishes. The fraternity consisted of the prior and between eight and ten canons, supported by a number of temporal staff. The priory was suppressed in 1537 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries carried out under King Henry VIII. Following the closure Sir Edmund Knevett, of Buckenham Castle, was granted a lease of the priory lands. The site is now part of Abbey Farm.


All that remains above ground of the priory itself is a single lump of mortared flint.

Hossian Miya (Utpal Dutta) is a Bengali Muslim trader who offers his community an idealistic vision: He wants to establish a little utopia on an island (Moynadeep) in the Padma delta and offer them a better life there. It is apparent that Hossian Miya has a flourishing business there, because he has recently purchased a huge boat because of expanding business. He doesn't care if the people who populate it are Hindu or Muslim. It is 1947, just before the partition of India, and the Hindu fisherman Kuber briefly accepts an offer by Hossain to ferry some of the community's cargo from the island. He would be fishing, except that the fish he usually catches have been driven away by a big storm.


In the process of getting the cargo, he gets to see what the colony is like and, even though he is fully aware of the gripes of a former colony member and the limitations of it, comes to share some of the utopian vision. When Kuber returns to his home and a variety of unfortunate events make it in his best interest to leave, he knows just where to go.


However, people who return from Moynadeep after working there has a different tale to narrate. Rasu (Sunil Mukherjee) and Aminuddin (Rabi Ghosh) say that Moynadeep is infested with lions and tigers, and there is forest all around. Rasu has fled from Moynadeep deserting his wife and children there. Aminuddin, too, refuses to go back to Moynadeep again. Kuber has a wife and daughter and was recently blessed with a child. His wife is beset with a leg deformity, and his daughter is grown up and engaged to a local man. Kuber goes to pay a visit to his relatives from his wife's side. On return, he brings along his sister-in-law Kapila (Roopa Ganguly) with a ton of small kids. Kapila was married but is now estranged from her husband. A sneaky amorous relationship develops between Kubir and Kapila. Staying with a deformed wife and coupled with amorous gestures from his alluring sister-in-law Kubir succumbs to her wishes of passion play. However, Kapila's husband re-appears and takes her away with him.


One day a storm rises in the Padma River and leaves behind a trail of destruction. Kuber tells his wife ""Padda amago joto daay abar totoi loy"" (It is true Padda gives us a lot, but in return it also takes a lot from us). The storm wreaks havoc in the village. Hussian Miya offers to lend a helping hand to the villagers. He does so, but in return he takes their thumb impressions as proof of his help so that he can use it later to exploit them. Meanwhile, Kuber's daughter's marriage breaks down. Rasu proposes to marry her. Even though Rasu was close to Kuber, he refuses to accept the match because of the age difference between them. Rasu becomes furious and threatens to ruin Kuber. He succeeds in his endeavor. Kuber is fabricated in a theft case, and police is now trying to nab him. He flees to Hussain Miya for help. Hossain Miya tells he can absolve him of the theft charge, but in return Kubir must go to Moynadeep. Kuber agrees to the offer. Kuber goes to Moynadeep. A new life unfolds for him there.

46661872,Opicinumab,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opicinumab,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Opicinumab&action=info,"Opicinumab (BIIB033) is a fully human monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, acute optic neuritis (AON), and other associated demyelinating diseases. A biologic drug, it is designed to function as a LINGO-1 protein antagonist, known as âAnti-Lingo-1â.


Some Phase II clinical trials have been carried out, but preliminary results indicate that primary study endpoints were not met and that opicinumab exhibits unexpected dose-response relationships. Further studies were planned by the company, as opicinumab still was deemed to show potential for clinical efficacy in the treatment of MS.


Opicinumab is designed to prevent the advancement of demyelination associated with neurodegenerative disorders, specifically MS.  It is believed to function by allowing young cells, which would normally be prevented from maturing by the LINGO-1 protein, to mature into functional oligodendrocytes.  Oligodendrocytes support nerve axons and serve to maintain the myelin sheath that allows for the effective conduction of axon potentials.  LINGO-1 is only found in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and is thought to be at least a partial causative agent of MS, an autoimmune disorder.  It is thought that by allowing oligodendrocytes to mature, further disability advancement  caused by MS can be prevented, with reversal of demyelination associated with MS potentially achievable.


Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are currently ongoing for opicinumab. Completed Phase I trials assessed safety and efficacy in healthy people and in MS patients, as well as investigated pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug.


Biogen has an ongoing Phase 1 trial that is investigating the safety of ocipinumab produced via two different manufacturing processes in healthy individuals.  That trial is set to conclude November 2016. Clinical trial number NCT02833142 for ""Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Single Doses of BIIB033 (Opicinumab) Produced by 2 Manufacturing Processes"" at ClinicalTrials.gov</ref>


The completed Phase II trial, dubbed RENEW by Biogen, studied the potential clinical efficacy of opicinumab in treating AON, more specifically in repairing damage done to the optic nerve.  The study successfully reached its primary endpoint and showed a 34 percent partial recovery of optic nerve latency, a measure of the time of conduction from the retina to the visual cortex. On RENEW's secondary endpoint, there was no statistically significant change in either visual function or retinal thickness.


The second completed Phase II clinical trial for opicinumab, called SYNERGY by Biogen, concluded in March 2016 but failed to reach its primary endpoint, which was an integrated measure of several MS progression and disability markers:  ambulation, extremity functionality, cognition, and other typical indicators of MS. Results from the study also showed highly unanticipated dose-response relationships in the MS patient population that will likely require further clinical trials to investigate satisfactorily.


Biogen, Inc. filed its first patent application with WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) in 2008, wherein the potential to target LINGO-1 in patients suffering from MS was described.


In January 2016, Biogen filed a second patent application with WIPO that specifically described and protected BIIB003 (opicinumab). By filing with WIPO, the overseeing organization for the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), Biogen gains an extra year of intellectual property (IP) exclusivity after submitting its international patent application with WIPO to apply for patents in all desired member states of the PCT. Therefore, Biogen has until January 2017 to file patent applications for opicinumab in multiple countries of its choosing, after which its IP will no longer be protected by the PCT.",0,10 May 2015, 18 July 2021,31,0,0

Petrov (Russian: Ð®. ÐÐµÑÑÐ¾ÌÐ², IPA:Â [Ëju pÊ²ÉªËtrof] (listen)) published in the West to avoid censorship in the Soviet Union. Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky were convicted of Anti-Soviet agitation in a show trial, becoming the first Soviet writers convicted solely for their works and for fiction, serving five years at a Gulag camp and prison.


Yuli Daniel was born on 15 November 1925 in Moscow, Soviet Union, the son of the Russian Jewish Yiddish playwright M. Daniel (Mark Naumovich Meyerovich, Russian: ÐÐ°ÑÐº ÐÐ°ÑÐ¼Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ ÐÐµÐµÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ). In 1942, the 17-year-old Daniel lied about his age and volunteered to serve on the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 3rd Belorussian Front during Eastern Front of World War II. In 1944, Daniel was critically wounded in his legs and was demobilized from the Red Army. In 1950, Daniel graduated from Moscow Pedagogical Institute (now Moscow State Regional University), and went to work as a schoolteacher in Kaluga and Moscow.


Daniel also published translations of verse from a variety of languages, and like his friend Andrei Sinyavsky, wrote topical stories and novellas which were sometimes satirical or critical of Soviet society but naturally rejected for publication by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during a time of extreme censorship in the Soviet Union. Daniel and Sinyavsky smuggled their works out of the Soviet Union as samizdat to France to be published under pseudonyms. Daniel married Larisa Bogoraz, who later also became a famous Soviet dissident.


Daniel's work Moscow Speaking, published in 1959 under the pseudonym Nikolai Arzhak, caught the attention of the KGB, the main security agency and secret police of the Soviet Union. The KGB began investigating Daniel and Sinyavsky's dissident works being published in the West, and soon linked their pseudonyms to their real identities. Daniel and Sinyavsky were placed under constant surveillance and investigation by the KGB for several years.


In September 1965, Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested and tried in the infamous Sinyavsky-Daniel trial for their literary works published abroad. The Soviet prosecution could not charge Daniel and Sinyavsky for publishing material abroad or using pseudonyms as both were legal under Soviet Law, instead they were charged with the offense of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda under Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code.
Both writers entered a plea of not guilty, which was unusual for defendants in Soviet show trials. On February 14, 1966, Daniel was sentenced to five years of hard labor for ""anti-Soviet activity"" while Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years.


In 1967, Andrei Sakharov appealed on behalf of Daniel directly to Yuri Andropov, at the time Chairman of the KGB. Sakharov was told that both Daniel and Sinyavsky would be released under a general amnesty on the fiftieth anniversary of the October revolution, but this turned out to be false as the amnesty did not apply to political prisoners. Daniel spent four years of captivity at the Dubravlag, a Gulag camp in Mordovia, and one year in Vladimir Prison.


Daniel was released and refused to emigrate, as was customary among Soviet dissidents, and lived in Kaluga before moving to Moscow.


According to Fred Coleman, ""Historians now have no difficulty pinpointing the birth of the modern Soviet dissident movement. It began in February 1966 with the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, two Russian writers who ridiculed the Communist regime in satires smuggled abroad and published under pen names. They didn't realize at the time that they were starting a movement that would help end Communist rule.""


Daniel and Sinyavsky did not intend to oppose the Soviet Union. Daniel was genuinely worried about a resurgence of the Cult of Personality under Nikita Khrushchev, which inspired his story This is Moscow Speaking, while Sinyavsky affirmed that he believed socialism was the way forward but that the methods employed were at times erroneous. Shortly before Daniel's death, Bulat Okudzhava acknowledged that some translations published under his name had in fact been ghostwritten by Daniel, because he was featured on a blacklist of authors banned from being published in the Soviet Union.


Daniel died on 30 December 1988, and Sinyavsky and his wife Maria Rozanova immediately flew to his funeral from France, where they had emigrated in 1973 after Sinyavsky's release. Daniel was buried in Vagankovo Cemetery, a popular burial place in Moscow for members of the arts community.

The MRT Chalerm Ratchamongkol line (Thai: à¸£à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸à¸à¸£ à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸£à¸±à¸à¸¡à¸à¸à¸¥) or MRT Blue Line (Thai: à¸£à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸² à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¸ªà¸µà¸à¹à¸³à¹à¸à¸´à¸) is Bangkok's third rapid transit line, following the Sukhumvit line and Silom line of the BTS Skytrain. It is the first of the MRT system and is operated by Bangkok Expressway and Metro (BEM). The original 20Â km MRT Blue Line from Hualumphong to Bang Sue opened on 3 July 2004. A 1.2Â km extension to Tao Poon opened on 11 August 2017. The 15.9Â km western extension to Lak Song opened for full service on 29 September 2019 and the 11Â km extension from Tao Poon to Tha Phra to form the quasi loop, opened for full service on 30 March 2020.


The line has a total length of 48Â km, being a quasi circle route of the Bangkok rapid transit network. The MRT Blue line connects major business, residential and cultural areas of Bangkok. In late 2019, the daily average daily ridership was 400,000. In mid 2021, during a COVID-19 3rd wave in Bangkok ridership plummeted to between 76,000 - 116,000 per weekday.


The MRT Blue Line starts at the upper platform of Tha Phra station. It runs on an elevated viaduct northward along Charan Sanit Wong Road to Bang O station. Then turning eastwards crossing the Chao Phraya River, entering Bang Pho station and Tao Poon station in Bang Sue District. The line then descends to an underground section. It follows the Kamphaeng Phet, Phahon Yothin and Lat Phrao Roads, then turns south following Ratchadaphisek Road to Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre station. It then turns west following Rama IV Road. It passes Hua Lamphong station in Pathum Wan District, through Chinatown, then under the Chao Phraya River before ascending onto an elevated viaduct to the lower platform of Tha Phra station. The line continues west along Phet Kasem Road to Lak Song station in Bang Khae, situated near Kanchanaphisek Road or Western Outer Ring road. It forms a quasi circle loop around Bangkok.


Officially named Chaloem Ratchamongkhon (Thai à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸£à¸±à¸à¸¡à¸à¸à¸¥) â ""Celebration of Royal Auspice"" â or informally but commonly called as the ""MRT Blue Line"", this was the first metro line under the newly formed government agency, the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA). Most civil infrastructure was provided by this government agency and handed over to a private sector on a 25-year concessionaire agreement. The winning bidder was Bangkok Expressway and Metro (BEM). Under this agreement, BEM provides maintenance and engineering equipment, including electrical trains, signalling systems, SCADA, communication, platform screen doors and fully operate the system from Hua Lamphong to Bang Sue. BEM has subcontracted maintenance of the system for 10 years to Siemens and seven-year maintenance contracts to two local maintenance services.


Construction of the line from Hua Lamphong to Bang Sue began on 19 November 1996. The project suffered multiple delays not only because of the 1997 economic crisis, but also due to challenging civil engineering works of constructing massive underground structures deep in the water-logged soil upon which the city is built. The MRT Blue Line opened for a limited public trial period of several weeks starting on 13 April 2004. On 3 July 2004, the line was officially opened at 19:19 local time by HM King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who were accompanied by other members of the royal family. Within 30 minutes of its opening, sightseers filled the system to its maximum capacity, but after the initial rush ridership settled down to around 180,000 riders daily â considerably lower than projections of over 400,000, despite fares being slashed in half from 12 to 38 baht to 10-15 baht per trip.


As part of the rapid transit master plan the original MRT Blue Line section was planned to be extended from Hua Lamphong to Lak Song, and from Bang Sue to Tha Phra, forming a circle open-loop route. The contract for the first part of extension to Tao Poon was signed on 26 August 2009 as part of MRT Purple Line contract as it provided interchange to the MRT Purple Line. The 1.2Â km Bang Sue to Tao Poon extension opened on 11 August 2017. This added the first elevated station, Tao Poon, to the Blue line.


The major extension of the MRT Blue Line was the 27Â km extension west to Lak Song and from Tao Poon to Tha Phra with 19 stations consisting of four underground and 15 elevated stations. Contracts for civil work were divided into five contracts. Successful bids were announced in late 2010. On 17 February 2011, the five contracts were signed.


Construction commenced in mid-2011 for a scheduled 2016 opening but this was subsequently delayed to 2019â2020. In August, 2017, BEM awarded the automatic fare collection ticket for the extension to Thales which to install its TransCity system. The contract also includes ongoing training and future support. In September 2017, BEM announced that Siemens and ST Electronics Thailand were awarded the contract (Contract 5) to supply, install and maintain the E&S systems systems, install station platform screen doors and fit out the depot. Siemens also won the contract to supply 35 sets of rolling stock.


In 2017, the cabinet approved the amendment of the Blue line concession with BEM, and the new agreement was signed on 31 March 2017. Under the new agreement, BEM will operate the new extensions from Hua Lampong to Lak Song and Bang Sue to Tha Phra. The concession period was extended from 2029 to 2050.

The extension was opened in stages. The Hua Lamphong - Lak Song extension was opened for trial service on 29 July with full commercial services commencing 29 September 2019.


The Tao Poon - Tha Phra extension opened for limited trial services from 29 November 2019 with full commercial services commencing on 30 March 2020.


The MRT Blue line is served by 54 three-car trains of which, 19 are first generation Siemens Modular Metro sets and 35 sets are second generation. The trains are powered by 750v DC via third rail system, are air-conditioned and capable of traveling at up to 80Â km/h.


19 three-car Siemens Modular Metro were ordered for the initial part of the line. The trains entered service on 3 July 2004. In 2017, BEM starts removing some seats from the train to increase interior space to cope with rising number of passengers. In 2019, the BEM stated that it is interested in refurbishing the first generation trains. Including the CCTV cameras, and new dynamic route map replacing the traditional ones.

In 2017, BEM ordered 35 three-car Siemens Modular Metros as part of the line extension program. Under the contract, Siemens were to supply 35 trains and provide maintenance for ten years with a price tag of 20 billion baht. The fleet was built at the Siemens plant in Vienna and tested in Germany. The first train arrived in 2019 with all trains delivered by early 2020.

The MRT Blue line runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song via Bang Sue, Phra Ram 9 and Hua Lamphong, serving 38 stations. The line operates everyday from 6am to midnight with headway of 4 minutes during rush hour and a maximum headway of 8 minutes after 10 pm.


All stations on the line are equipped with platform screen doors. Stations are built to accommodate six-car trains, but only three-car trains were used. Uniformed security personnel and security cameras are present at every platform. Passenger announcements on this line are made by journalist and news broadcaster Sarocha Pornudomsak. The line has 2 depots, one in Huai Khwang District, which is located between Phra Ram 9 and Thailand Cultural Centre station. The 2nd depot is located in Chom Thong District, near Phetkasem 48 station.


Fares increased by 1 baht from 1 January 2021. For example, a one station journey increases to Bt17 from Bt16, four stations to Bt24 from Bt23, seven stations to Bt31 from Bt30 and 10 stations to Bt38 from Bt37. The maximum fare is 42 baht.


At opening in 2004, initial ridership was 180,000 per day â considerably lower than the projections of over 400,000. By 2016, the average daily ridership was 273,637. By September 2017, BEM stated that average daily ridership had increased to 360,000 after the opening of the extension to Tao Poon.


After the opening of the extension to Lak Song on 29 September 2019, average daily ridership increased to 400,000. The MRT Blue line was expected to grow to a daily ridership of 800,000 once the Lak Song and Tha Phra extensions opened. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by late 2020 had resulted in a dramatic reduction of ridership down to an average of 360,000 per weekday reverting to September 2017 levels. By August 2021, during a COVID-19 3rd wave in Bangkok ridership plummeted to only 76,000 per weekday.


On 17 January 2005, just after 09:15, an empty train returning to the depot collided with a peak-hour train filled with passengers at the Thailand Cultural Centre station. Around 100-262 people, depending on the news source, were injured. Most of whom sustained only minor injuries, and the entire Metro network was shut down for two weeks. On 31 January 2005 then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra ride the metro to increase public confident in the system.


After initial investigations, it was found that the empty train had run into problems shortly before the accident, grinding to a halt on a curve leading to the depot. The driver applied its brake and was waiting to be towed to the depot close to Thailand Cultural Centre station. A rescue train was attempting to connect to the stalled train when the driver was told to release the brake while coupling had not yet been successful. It was then that the empty train began to roll backwards at a speed of ten meters per second, before smashing into the other train, which was carrying passengers. Therefore, it was believed that the incident was caused by negligence due to insufficient training of operation staff. This accident also resulted in two damaged trains with heavily damaged areas limited to the two leading cars. The colliding speed was suspected to be about 60Â km/h due to the appearance of damaged areas. However, one train, which was rebuilt from the repair of the minor-damaged cars, was already fitted for operation at the end of 2006 and the remaining one was still under heavy repair until mid of 2007; it was released into service in October 2007. The cost resulting from the accident might be a much higher figure than BEM quoted, and it was expected to be at least 400 million baht, which was totally insured by a local insurance company.


The line resumed full operations on 1 February 2005. Passenger numbers soon rose back to pre-crash levels, partly due to a temporary promotional fare scheme which allowed passengers to travel any distance on the MRT for only ten baht.


Since 2011, there were requests from residents to extend the line farther from Lak Song west to the Phutthamonthon area. The MRTA indicated a willingness to undertake this extension. In July 2014, the MRTA submitted a request for 84 million baht to complete a route survey for a 7.8Â km, 4 station extension from Lak Song to Phutthamonthon Sai 4. In late March 2017, the Transport Ministry stated that this 7.8Â km extension would be submitted to Cabinet for approval in April 2017 with construction expected to commence in the 4th quarter of 2017. However, the tender was subsequently delayed until late 2019 due to other projects. In late 2019, the project was put on hold due to government budget constraints. In August 2021, the MRTA confirmed that the extension was not a priority especially given delays with the tenders for the MRT Orange and MRT Purple line extensions.",3,31 March 2010, 23 September 2021,416,4,3

The bridge was designed by Glasgow City Engineer Thomas Somers and built by Melville Dundas & Whitson. It links the southside Tradeston area to Oswald Street in the city Centre. The bridge was commissioned in 1914, but was delayed due to the First World War: the bridge was not completed and opened until 1928. It is now protected as a category B listed building.

The Bessungen orangery building is now used for concerts and meetings, also has a restaurant.


Darmstadt started in 1886 with a steam tram system, that later evolved (with a short period of also including trolleybuses from 1944 to 1963) into a 36.2Â km network by 2001. Darmstadt had not scrapped this comparatively extensive network after World War II as many other cities did, though some links were decommissioned in the 1960s and 1970s and replaced by bus lines of which the city also has an extensive network.
Tram Lines 6,7, and 8 service Darmstadt-Arheilgen. The central nodal point of the Darmstadt tramway network is the Luisenplatz in the city center of Darmstadt.

Fair, and sometimes called Seymore de Faire or Seymour d'Fair) is a cartoon animal and costumed character who was the official mascot of the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition. An anthropomorphic white pelican, Seymore typically wears a blue tuxedo jacket, large top hat, spats, and white gloves. His name is derived from the N'Awlins ""Yat"" phrase ""See more of the fair"".  Seymore was the ""world's 1st-ever"" character mascot in the history of World Expositions.


Seymore promoted the New Orleans World's Fair globally, including in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, and London. During the 1984 Republican National Convention, he interacted on stage with George H. W. Bush, Vice-President of the United States and numerous Chiefs of State. In Washington, D.C., he hung out with Billy Joel at the White House entertaining wives of Russian diplomats.[citation needed]  Seymore appeared on Saturday Night Live, shown guarding an entrance to the White House with Secret Service agents.[citation needed]


For the first 10 months of his existence, Seymore was simply referred to as Mr. Pelican. Later, fair management worked with a local convenience store chain to create a naming contest, which resulted in over 18,000 name submissions. Judges included local celebrities such as Angus Lind and Bob Marshall of the States Item.  Other submitted names included Crazy-Laid-Back Fred, Puddin Pus, and Valdimir. 


The winner of the contest was Susan Shambra, a computer operator for a local insurance company. Seymore's name, is a derivative of the local Yat dialect translation of ""See More of the Fair""' as ""Seymore D' Fair.""


Several actors were hired to perform as Seymore during the fair, including Jeff Davis, a Southern Mississippi alumnus who also wore their school mascot for four years prior to his graduation. In 1983, Jeff traveled the world as Seymore promoting the fair and continued through the fair's closing in November 1984.[citation needed]


In addition to his job at the New Orleans World's Fair, Seymore engaged in numerous educational, civic, and community causes, most notably Substance Free Lifestyles, Animal Welfare, and Positive Behavior programs.  In 1986 he and his Critter friends performed with First Lady Nancy Reagan in the national ""Just Say No"" Rally held in the Louisiana Superdome.


Inspired by the First Lady's anti-drug campaign, Seymore & the Critters joined forces with local law enforcement agencies in 1986 to produce a drug education program titled ""Critters & Kids Just Say NO to Drugs"". The  two-part program consisted of a 45-minute live theater presentation and a post program classroom teaching unit. Approximately 100 public, private, and parochial schools from the metro New Orleans area participated with 40,000 K-6 students attended the live theater presentation. At that time, Harry Lee Jefferson Parish Sheriff proclaimed that the Critters & Kids Just Say No program was the largest singular drug education effort in Louisiana history.


At the close of the fair in November 1984, Seymore was enshrined alongside Dorothy's ruby slippers in the Smithsonian Institution.  He was also inducted into the New Orleans Historic Collection and the Louisiana State Archives where he is prominently displayed. Seymore and his friends known as the ""Critters"" were appointed ""Ambassadors of Goodwill"" for the State of Louisiana by then Governor Edwin E. Edwards. New Orleans Mayor Ernest ""Dutch"" Morial issued a proclamation in 1986 proclaiming January 24 as ""Seymore D' Fair"" day.


To foster and support Seymore's community programs, the Seymore D. Fair Foundation was established in 2015.  The foundation is a registered 501(3)c organization that supports the advancement of children's education efforts throughout the world.


A national nonprofit advocacy organization for children the Seymore D. Fair Foundation is dedicated to promoting the empowerment of people, the welfare of animals, and protection of the planet.

He was a professor of literature at National Peking University, and along with Gu Jiegang, one of the leaders of the Doubting Antiquity School.


Born in Huzhou, Zhejiang, Qian was named Qian Xia at birth and was given the courtesy name Deqian (å¾·æ½). Qian trained in traditional Chinese philology. After receiving his university education in Japan, Qian held a number of teaching positions in mainland China. He was a student of Zhang Binglin; some of Zhang's works were copied and printed in Qian's remarkable seal script handwriting. As a philologist, Qian was the first to reconstruct the vowel system of Old Chinese in IPA.


A close friend of Lu Xun, Qian was a key figure in the May Fourth Movement and the New Culture Movement. Despite his close relationship with the Chinese classics, he promoted the abolition of classical Chinese. He was also a strong supporter of Esperanto, at one time even proposed the substitution of Chinese by it. An open letter he wrote in response to an anti-Confucian essay of Chen Duxiu stated:


Dear Mr. Chen, 
In an early essay of yours you strongly advocated the abolition of Confucianism. Concerning this proposal of yours I think that it is now the only way to save China. But upon reading it I have thought of one more thing: if you want to abolish Confucianism you must first abolish the Chinese [written] language. If you want to get rid of the average person's childish, uncivilized, obstinate way of thinking, then it is all the more essential that you first abolish the Chinese language. To abolish Confucianism and eliminate Taoism is a fundamental way to prevent the fall of China and to allow the Chinese to become a civilized nation in the twentieth century. But a more fundamental way than this is to abolish the written Chinese language, in which Confucian thoughts and fallacious Taoist sayings are recorded.

Chen thought that abolishing written Chinese would destroy the spoken language as well and countered Qian's proposal by suggesting that Chinese could use a Roman alphabet.


He and Liu Bannong did their best to promote vernacular Chinese, attacking such classical Chinese stylists as Lin Shu. His skepticism of the Chinese heritage was such that he at one time wanted to change his surname to Yigu (çå¤ ""suspecting things ancient"").

7964216,Satyendra Narayan Sinha,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Narayan_Sinha,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Satyendra_Narayan_Sinha&action=info,"Satyendra Narayan Sinha (12 July 1917 â 4 September 2006) was an Indian politician and statesman, participant in the Indian independence movement, a leading light of Jaya Prakash Narayan's âcomplete revolutionâ movement during the Emergency and a former Chief Minister of Bihar. Affectionately called Chhote Saheb, he was also a seven-time Member of Parliament from the Aurangabad constituency, a three-term Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, and a Member of the Bihar Legislative Council once. Regarded to be one of India's most influential regional people of the time, his reputation was synonymous with being a strict disciplinarian and tough taskmaster.


Sinha was born in an aristocratic political family in Poiwan, Aurangabad district, Bihar. He belonged to the rajput caste. His father was a nationalist leader, Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha, who closely assisted Mahatma Gandhi along with Dr.Rajendra Prasad in the Champaran Satyagraha movement, the first satyagraha movement in the country and also served as the first Deputy Chief Minister cum Finance Minister of the Indian state of Bihar.


He spent his student years under the tutelage of Lal Bahadur Shastri at Allahabad. Brought up in a political environment, S. N. Sinha completed his bachelor's degree from Allahabad University and earned a degree in law from Lucknow University. He practised law at the Patna High Court, but left his job to join the Indian Independence movement and participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942. He organised Legal Aid Programmes for political prisoners during pre-Independence days.


After Independence he was elected to the provisional Parliament from Bihar in 1950. He was part of the young Turk brigade of the Indian National Congress party during the time of the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru.


Satyendra Narayan Sinha was a prominent educationist, and served as the Education Minister of unified Bihar in the government headed by Chief Minister Pandit Binodanand Jha from 1961 to 1963, and again for two consecutive terms in the Cabinet of K. B. Sahay from 1963 to 1967. He also a held a range of portfolios including Local Self Government and Agriculture. He is credited with streamlining the entire education system of the Bihar state. As the state education minister, he played an instrumental role in the establishment of Magadh University in Bodh Gaya, in the year 1962. He occupied the second position (second-in-command) in the Cabinet and played the role of a de facto Chief Minister during the period 1961â1967 under the Governments headed by K. B. Sahay and Pandit Binodanand Jha. He had a unique political acumen to determine the electoral prospects of candidates in assembly election by just sitting at home in Patna.


S. N. Sinha also played a key role in the installations of Governments headed by chief ministers Krishana Ballabh Sahay, Satish Prasad Singh, B.P. Mandal, Sardar Harihar Singh, Bhola Paswan Shastri and Ram Sundar Das. He never hankered after power even when it was well within his reach. When Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister of India in 1966, she wanted him to become the next Chief Minister of Bihar and sent then External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh to convey the proposal but he refused, since he did not wished to unseat incumbent CM K B Sahay but wanted to be elected by the people of state.


The Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, declared a state of emergency on 25 June 1975 due to internal political disturbances. Accordingly, all fundamental rights enjoyed in the Indian Constitution were suspended. Political dissidents, newspaper reporters, opposition leaders who opposed emergency were jailed. Chhote Saheb, along with other prominent leaders, opposed this blatant misuse of state machinery. In 1977, during the emergency in India, he was made president of Bihar Janata Party and Chairman of State Election Committee.


""Chhote Saheb, as he was popularly called, was an important political leader of Bihar, a distinguished Parliamentarian, and someone who had the interests of his state and people uppermost in his mind. During his long public life of over six decades, Sinha Ji made significant contributions in streamlining the education system of Bihar.""


â Vice President of India Hamid Ansari


He worked together with premier colleagues of Janata Party like Morarji Desai, Chandra Shekhar Singh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Charan Singh, Jagjivan Ram, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Madhu Limaye, H. D. Deve Gowda, Inder Kumar Gujral, Raj Narain, George Fernandes and Karpuri Thakur and the movement was a grand success in Bihar. He motivated the youth and students to take an active role in politics, and ensured their representation in political affairs. During, the Bihar legislative assembly election 1977, a massive crowd of youth leaders and activists used to converge at his residence.


Satyendra Narayan Sinha's political encouragement to the youths led to the emergence of then youth leaders of Janata Party like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Nitish Kumar, Ram Vilas Paswan, Subodh Kant Sahay, Kripanath Pathak, Ram Jatan Sinha, Jagdish Sharma, Thakur Muneshwar Nath Singh, Raghupati Singh and Narendra Singh. After the emergency was lifted on 21 March 1977, fresh general elections were held in India.


The Congress Party, led by Indira Gandhi suffered a defeat at the hands of the Janata Party coalition of several small parties created in 1977 and the alliance came to power, headed by Morarji Desai, who became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. In Bihar, the Janata Party won all the fifty-four Lok Sabha seats in 1977 general elections under the mentorship of Jayaprakash Narayan and rose to power in Bihar assembly too. He struck by the Janata Party and preferred to be in opposition although he would have been considered a prize catch by the Congress party.


He quit the party following differences with the then party president Chandra Shekhar Singh and returned to the Congress fold in 1984. The then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi came down to Patna to formally admit him back to the Congress party.


As the Chief Minister of Bihar, Chhote Saheb also held the portfolio of Education for the fourth term in his later years 1989â1990. In the same year, he conceived, the proposal to set up a NTPC's super thermal power project at Nabinagar in Bihar's Aurangabad district to then Prime Minister of India and Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi; but the project went into limbo as the following state governments failed to follow it. In 2007, Manmohan Singh's government finally put a stamp of approval on it.


""I believe in participative democracy and not dictatorial attitudes""


â Satyendra Narayan Sinha


"" He was a great humanitarian and an educationist who changed the face of education in Bihar by his radical and innovative ideas that were far ahead of their time. The state owes a lot to him..""


â Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar


He is also credited for the establishment of the Indira Gandhi Planetarium cum Science Centre in Patna. Under his regime, Panchayati Raj system of governance was introduced in Bihar.


In his autobiography Meri Yaadein, Meri Bhoolein, released by the then Bihar Governor Buta Singh in the presence of Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee (also former President of India), He accused his state colleagues of ""fanning"" the 1989 Bhagalpur violence to malign him, specifically mentioning his predecessor and former chief minister Bhagwat Jha Azad and the former speaker Shivchandra Jha. He didn't agree with the over-ruling of his order to transfer the then superintendent of police K S Dwivedi who had failed miserably to discharge his duties. The decision was not only an encroachment of the Constitutional right of the state government but also a step detrimental to ongoing efforts to ease tensions. When he stepped down from the post of Chief Minister of Bihar, Jagannath Mishra succeeded him. He recalled when he met Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi later on, he informed him about the ""role of some Congress leaders"" in the riots. The Prime Minister expressed surprise and said ""so, the riots were motivated!""


S. N. Sinha was elected as a Member of the First, Second and Fifth to Eighth Lok Sabhas from 1950 to 1961 and 1971â1989 representing Aurangabad parliamentary constituency of Bihar. He retains the record of maximum parliamentary election victories in Bihar, next only to the late Jagjivan Ram.


He served as the Chairman of Committee on Estimates from 1977 to 1979. He was also a Member of the Committee on Finance from 1950 to 1952; Committee on Estimates from 1956 to 1958 and thereafter during 1985â1986 and the Committee on Public Undertakings during 1982â83. He was a well-known social activist, and served as the Assistant Secretary to the Bihar Provincial Committee of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund and Secretary to the Bihar Provincial Committee of the Gandhi National Memorial Fund. He was also associated with a number of educational and social institutions in different capacities. He was member, Senate and Syndicate of Patna University from 1946 to 1960 and Bihar University from 1958 to 1960.


A widely travelled person, S. N. Sinha attended Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, Helsinki, Finland in 1955. He was the leader of the cultural delegation to Kabul on the occasion of Jasan in 1963. He also led the Indian Parliamentary Delegation to the Spring Meetings of Inter-Parliamentary Council, Canberra in 1977 and also to its meeting at Lisbon in 1978. He was a member of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation to erstwhile USSR in 1976 and was elected a member of the Special Committee on Violations of Human Rights of Parliamentarians at Canberra in 1977 representing Asia. He was also elected President of that committee (conferred upon the status of a Union Cabinet Minister) and served as its Chief from 1977 to 1988.


S.N. Sinha held the following posts in his political career:


S. N. Sinha's wife Kishori Sinha is a former Member of Parliament from Vaishali, and his daughter-in-law Shyama Singh is a former Member of Parliament from Aurangabad. His son, Nikhil Kumar, a former IPS official, has served as the Governor of the Indian state of Nagaland and also as the Governor of Kerala.


S. N. Sinha wrote his autobiography Meri Yadein: Meri Bhoolein, which incorporates the experiences and perceptions of a leader of his eminence and stature.


His official residence in Delhi, 28 Akbar Road, had consistently won awards for being one of the best kept bungalows in the national capital. Its grand garden continually won awards at all Delhi's flower shows and was one of capital's landmark gardens.


The Congress government led by Sinha is criticized for the lackadaisical approach towards the handling of  the 1989 Bhagalpur violence. The N.N Singh Committee report tabled in the Bihar legislative assembly held the government responsible for taking no action and the police showing complete inactivity during one of the biggest instances of human rights violations in Bihar, which led to the displacement of over 50,000 Muslims. The riots are said to have claimed the lives of thousands of Muslims, mostly poor weavers, while the police and Congress administration under Sinha took no action.


The inaugural lecture of the annual Satyendra Narayan Sinha Memorial Lecture Series was delivered by Vice-President of India Shri Hamid Ansari in Patna. In 2014, the then Bihar CM announced to rename Magadh University of which Late Sinha was the founder as Satyendra Narayan Sinha Magadh University. The Children's Park in the capital Patna has now been rechristened as Satyendra Narayan Sinha Park and the foundation for installing a life-size statue of former Bihar CM was laid by Chief Minister Shri Nitish Kumar at a state function in 2015.",5,16 November 2006, 14 September 2021,642,2,2

In his book he provides a wide-range report of current research on cosmology, the study of the universe, and its trends going into the 21st century. He reports on theories about the possibility that our universe is one among many, the Big Bang theory, Black holes, the ""expanding"" universe, and ""curved"" space. The book has twelve chapters with most of it exploring the Big Bang theory and the mass density of the universe.


Ferris is a prizewinning author who has been called ""the greatest science writer in the world."" He conceived and produced the Voyager phonograph record. As a professor he has taught astronomy, English, history, journalism, and philosophy at four universities. Ferris has been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in the category of general non-fiction for his physics and astronomy knowledge.


He starts the book with quantum physics explaining Î© (dark matter and all mass density) and how it is measured. Cosmologists believe the universe is flat and that Î© equals one. They theorize the universe will continue expanding but at a slower and slower rate, never stopping completely. He explains that foundation models of the universe are not three-dimensional, but have a fourth spacetime continuum.  Ferris says cosmologist Andrei Linde estimates the radius of the universe to be an ""astronomical"" number of one followed by a trillion zeros centimeters.


The book is an overview which examines mapping of large scale structures, weird quantum effects and cosmic evolution.  Ferris talks of black holes and what would happen if an astronaut jumped into one. He goes on to explain that a ""boltzmon"" is very small particle, but contains a galaxy's worth of information. The book examines the pursuit of cosmologists to describe the universe conveniently in one mathematical formula, a goal Albert Einstein was trying to achieve in his ""unified theory."" The book also explains that virtually every society worldwide from ancient Egyptians to Native Americans to dwellers of modern cities have a supposition and hypothesis of the universe, which ultimately influences their thinking consciously and subconsciously.


Ferris explains in the beginning of his book the cosmological model as it has arrived to us today from ancient philosophy.  He then goes into quantum physics, deep explanations of the Big Bang Theory and that ""space"" and matter in the Big Bang theory were able to move faster than the speed of light. He further explains that ""space"" itself was being created at the same time as its astronomical objects therein. These objects and ""space"" together were expanding at this speed greater than light, at least for the first fraction of a second. Ferris writes for the reader to understand that ""space"" was created in the Big Bang and did not preexist. He explains that all ""space"" and matter in the universe were in a singularity before the Big Bang even started. This means a curvature of spacetime that's immeasurably large.


He goes on to explain that in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, the rule that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, does not apply to galaxies in an expanding universe. He further explains that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an expanding universe. In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist. Ferris refers to this phenomenon as a boundless steadily increasing and changing universe with a changing density.


Ferris in his book explains the dynamism of the universe and the origins of chemical elements. He further examines the mystery of the clumping together of the stars within galaxies. He gives an excerpt of the search for a Darwin type theory and explanation of the history of the universe. His research in how quantum mechanics works gives rise to why there may be many universes, not just one. While some may shun away from what appears to be difficult scientific material, journalist Charles Krauthammer encourages non-technical people to read the book because it is as intuitive an account of its essential ideaÂ â the curvature of spaceÂ â as I have ever read.


Ferris uses most of his book searching for the cosmic mass density value of Î©. He points out that if Î© is a number under 1, the
universe will expand forever. Contrary to this he shows that if Î© is a number greater than 1 then the universe will eventually collapse into itself in a ""big crunch"", the opposite of the Big Bang. Ferris then shows, in a third possibility, that the universe is hanging in the balance in a critical density that says Î© looks to be exactly 1. Ferris makes the summation the universe will then always expand, but at a slower and slower rate that never completely comes to a halt. He follows this up with some exceptions that Î© is not always observed as exactly 1 by all cosmologists.


Ferris believes that the Big Bang theory is correct because of microwave background radiation which gives space a temperature of 3 kelvins. The Hubble telescope has also shown, through the Doppler effect, that galaxies are moving away in proportion to their distances from earth, which is evident by the redshift caused by lower frequencies generated from their normal frequency radiation.
These detectable wavelength frequencies are at other than those of visible light. He explains in detail the Hubble constant, the ratio of the speed of a galaxy to its distance from earth.


Ferris speculates that there is at least one, if not several, Black Holes in the middle of our own Milky Way galaxy. Visible light is unable to reach our telescopes from the center of the galaxy, so higher radio ways are used for ""viewing."" He suggests that by searching for Bekenstein-Hawking radiation then we might be able to find these Black Holes.


According to Anthony Campbell's book review Ferris explains why cosmologists have their present-day philosophies. He points out that Ferris shows a mutual relationship between the very small and the very big. In the book the relativity specialists and the particle physicists seem to give rise to a universe that is from a single entity, a black hole perhaps. Ferris postulates that the strings of the superstring theory may be black holes.


In the book Ferris gives a detailed account of dark matter, a mysterious component of the universe that influences the behavior of galaxies. Cosmologists have made note of five levels of structures larger than galaxies. These are the so-called galaxy groups and clusters, galaxy clouds, superclusters, and supercluster complexes. Ferris points out in his book that it appears unlikely that the universe has a fractal geometry, that is larger and larger structuring complexes, because of his theories behind dark matter.


Ferris writes that the theory of a universe that expanded exponentially in the first fraction of a second may be one of the most productive thoughts in modern cosmology because it provides answers for many of the mysteries. He also writes of the state of the quantum theory to be indeterminate. Ferris tends to side with David Bohm's so called ""hidden-variables"" quantum theory in spite of the theoretical problems involved.


Ferris admits that there is a tendency for descriptions of cosmology towards philosophy and also to lean towards theology. His theories lean towards the basis that the span of human being existence is part of the universe design. His views of God are not as taught in churches and synagogs but that the existence of the ultimate cause and the essential nature of things are really unknown. He points out that one can not support the personal theology theories of conventional religions against today's established principles of cosmology. Ferris wraps up his book with intellectual arguments for God with his Contrarian Theological Afterword.",1,22 July 2009, 28 November 2020,55,0,0

He played college football for the University of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish. The American Football League's Kansas City Chiefs drafted him in his junior year, 1964, and he was traded to the AFL's Buffalo Bills for the 1965 season.  He won a starting job at tight end his rookie year with the Bills, and soon became an excellent tight end, being named an AFL All-Star in his first two seasons.


As a rookie, Costa averaged 19.1 yards per catch. For his career, he averaged 16.7 yards per catch. In his first year, in the 1965 AFL Championship game against the San Diego Chargers, he teamed with Ernie Warlick in one of the first uses of the ""double tight end"" formation installed by head coach Lou Saban.  Costa caught two passes for 32 yards, Warlick caught three for 35 yards and a touchdown as the Bills defeated the Chargers for the second consecutive year, this time shutting them out 23 - 0, the first shutout in AFL Championship game history.  In Costa's fifth year in pro football, he moved to offensive tackle and played that position for four years. After playing eight years for the Bills, he retired for one year, then came out of retirement to play for the Birmingham Americans of the World Football League in 1974 and Birmingham Vulcans in 1975.


Costa earned a B.A. degree in Communications from Notre Dame. He also held a Masters and Ph.D. from the California Graduate School of Theology. Paul was a full-time minister since retiring from football. He was a pastor for sixteen years, and traveled nationally and internationally as a speaker in churches, conferences, and schools. He co-authored a book with Dr. John Kelly (End Time Warriors) that was published by Regal Book.

It was armed with a M1919 Browning machine gun and could reach a maximum speed of 8Â mph (13Â km/h). The 3-Ton had a 17-US-gallon (64Â l) tank that gave it a maximum range of 34 miles (55Â km).


Design on the 3-ton tank started in mid-1917, before which American tank forces had been largely equipped with British or French examples. The 3-Ton was a two-man tank designed so that American forces could use another tank besides the Renault FT in battle, and was designed around the FT but as a cheaper alternative. Its two Ford Model T engines were controlled by the driver, seated at the front with a gunner beside him who had control of a .30-06Â (7.62Ã63mm) machine gun (either a M1917 Marlin machine gun or M1919 Browning machine gun) on a limited-traverse mount with approximately 550 rounds of ammunition. 


The initial production run of the 3-ton was of fifteen vehicles; one of these was sent to France for testing. A contract for 15,000 of these vehicles was awarded; however, the U.S tank corps felt it did not meet the requirements they wanted. The contract for the 15,000 tanks was ended by the Armistice, leaving only the fifteen original vehicles produced.



The French Army evaluated the Ford 3-Ton tank and thought it inferior to the native Renault FT. However, the 3-Ton Tank was seen to have potential as a cheap, light, all-terrain artillery tractor especially for batteries of the Canon de 75 modÃ¨le 1897. One thousand five hundred 3-Ton tanks were ordered from Ford but the Armistice intervened before any were delivered and the order was cancelled.

43953271,Polistes biglumis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polistes_biglumis,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polistes_biglumis&action=info,"Polistes biglumis is a species of social wasp within Polistes, the most common genus of paper wasp. It is distinguished mainly by its tendency to reside in montane climates in meadows or alpine areas. Selection pressure from the wasp's environment has led to several idiosyncrasies of its behavior and life cycle with respect to its relative species in the genus Polistes. It alone among paper wasps is often polyandrous. In addition, it has a truncated nesting season that gives rise to unique competitive dynamics among females of the species. P. biglumis wasps utilize an odor based recognition system that is the basis for all wasp to wasp interaction of the species. The wasp's life cycle is highly intertwined with that of Polistes atrimandibularis, an obligate social parasite wasp that frequently invades the combs of P. biglumis wasps.


The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus described Polistes biglumis in 1758. Its species name biglumis is a Latin phrase meaning ""two husks."" While no common name for the wasp exists in English, it is referred to as ""berg feldwespe"" in German (meaning ""mountain field wasp""). P. biglumis has been studied alongside Polistes snelleni and Polistes chinensis for comparison. P. biglumis was originally classified as a hornet in the genus Vespa but was reassigned to the genus Polistes, which is the largest genus of paper wasps in the family Vespidae.


This species resides mainly in mountainous zones in Southern Europe, and it is the only paper wasp that inhabits a mountainous clime. Due to its divergence from the more common temperate climes of its genus, it has developed several distinctions from other paper wasps that arise mainly from selective pressure due to the severe climate it commonly experiences. The climate shortens the nesting season of P. biglumis to around four months. In addition, the nests exhibit darker coloration, which allows them to absorb more heat from the sun. Workers are also often nonexistent in some populations of P. biglumis, which demonstrates a large dichotomy from other social wasps, whose most commonly seen specimens are the workers. Finally, because of the reduced nesting season as well as parasitism by other wasps, P. biglumis has developed nesting strategies that are both distinct from other paper wasps and variable among conspecific populations.


Polistes biglumis can reach a length of up to 16 millimetres (0.63Â in) (queen), 14 millimetres (0.55Â in) (workers), 15 millimetres (0.59Â in) (males). It is a larger species of wasp in comparison to its relatives in Polistes. It also exhibits darker coloration than that of other paper wasps; it has a black petiole for both sexes. The females exhibit black abdomens as well, with rare yellow spots. Males, however, have largely yellow abdomens. Adult wasps can be distinguished from the young because they are darkly colored and can fly, whereas young wasps have paler stripes and are flightless.


Workers and queens do not exhibit morphological differences, but they can be distinguished physically by the abundance of their fat layers and behaviorally through their relative foraging efforts. Queens have more abundant fat layers and are also significantly less likely to participate in foraging for the nest. In addition to a differential in the abundance of fat layers in their abdomens, the color of the fat layers is distinct for workers versus queens; the workers exhibited yellow fat layers while the queens exhibited milky fat layers.


The nests of P. biglumis are circular or elliptic in shape and are hung vertically via one pedicel. They are largely produced by the foundress during the phases of egg and larvae production. The peripheral cells are generally uninhabited. Nests are more likely to be closer to the ground versus other Polistes wasps because the ground offers thermal inertia and shelter from strong winds. The nest material is also key to nestmate recognition because nest surfaces are impregnated with the epicuticular hydrocarbons that establish the framework by which the individuals discriminate between other wasps.


This species resides mainly in mountainous zones in Southern Europe, especially in Italy and France, including the relatively cooler climate of the Alps and the relatively warmer climate of the Apennines (although neither climate is temperate, making P. biglumis anomalous among relatives in Polistes). MontgenÃ¨vre, a commune located in the French Cottian Alps, has been used extensively as a region to study the behavior of the wasp in its natural environment. In addition, P. biglumis can be found extending into Uzbekistan, Sweden, Germany, and Austria. While a few ecologists will attribute the name P. biglumis to a wasp species inhabiting Okkaido, Japan as well, the Japanese species is an undescribed species more closely related to P. nimpha than to the predominantly European P. biglumis described here. The species found in Japan has been closely studied alongside Polistes snelleni, another common Japanese paper wasp. 
The wasps of this species generally nest on the sides of rocks in meadows in the mountains or in alpine areas consisting of Pinus sylvestris and Larix decidua. The colonies inhabiting these nests are both small and rare, owing to the fact that the colony cycle for the wasp is truncated to only four months. On average, the colonies consist of about 30 individuals.


P. biglumis colonies are always founded by a single foundress wasp. New colonies become active in late May or early June each year, and the colony cycle terminates in September. Half of all P. biglumis nests will fail during the pre-emergence stage, and due to the limited colony cycle, foundresses cannot start a new nest for the season.
The egg stage of the Polistes biglumis wasp is around 2 weeks, and the male offspring are produced before female offspring in a sequential fashion. The rate of appearance of future queens, however, is affected by environmental factors in the region; early female offspring in cold areas with high parasitism have fatter, gyne-like bodies and less foraging effort than do female offspring in warm areas with low parasitism. Both the climate and the parasite prevalence affect the first female offspring's abundance of fat bodies independently of one another, but only climate affects the first female offspring's foraging effort. Parasitism has no effect on late female offspring, but climate still affects the fat layers of their bodies. P. biglumis may have been selected for suppressed worker production in the first brood, the only brood not destroyed by parasites, so that new queens would survive to produce new colonies. 
The colony cycle is characterized by a pre-emergence period that lasts from foundation by the single gyne of the colony to the emergence of the first new worker, and a post-emergence period, from the emergence of the new worker to the end of the cycle (as an annual species, this marks the end of the colony). At the end of a season, the future queen females of the colony will overwinter in order to reproduce in the spring.


Polistes biglumis wasps exhibit a homogeneous odor that is both species specific and colony specific, and it is used by individuals to recognize nestmates. This system of recognition utilizes epicuticular saturated hydrocarbons. The queen produces the odor specific epicuticular hydrocarbons and transfers them to the nest paper. Wasps learn to recognize nestmates via the nest paper odor, which serves as a template for recognizing any wasp and determining whether or not to act aggressively toward it. Although epicuticular hydrocarbons cover the adults and larvae of Polistes biglumis, as well as their nest surfaces, newly emerged P. biglumis wasps will be accepted in foreign colonies of the same species, whereas adult non-nestmates will be met with violent aggression, usually until the invading wasp is killed. The distinction between aggression toward foreign newly emerged versus adult wasps could arise from a low level of epicuticular hydrocarbons developed in newly emerged wasps with respect to adult wasps. This low level is tantamount to a weakening of the signal. Similarly, a dead adult wasp that has been stripped of its epicuticular hydrocarbon layer will elicit no reaction in a foreign nest.


P. biglumis females have also developed a method for discriminating between their own and foreign conspecific eggs that will become queens; they will tend to eat foreign wasp eggs. Cues for distinguishing the eggs are located on the eggs themselves. This discrimination is a useful tactic both for foundresses that are in conflict with usurpers or joiners, and for usurpers and joiners themselves. No such system of recognition exists for eggs that will develop into workers.


P. biglumis males typically return to sunlit landmarks in their patrol flights repetitiously. Males adopt certain tiny territories, usually small stones or scrubs within a larger mating region that they patrol, defend against intruders, and mark with scent. Both the suitability of the microclimate of the territory adopted by the male and the conspicuousness of the territory against the terrain affect the mate-locating efficacy of the species. Males will attempt to copulate with females resting on their habitual perches in their discrete territories within a larger mating aggregation, characteristic of a lek mating system. Landmark mating in this system is advantageous for the promotion of outbreeding. Each lek is composed of related males that capture contiguous territories. One-third of all P. biglumis females will mate with multiple male partners, all of whom will be related. P. biglumis femalesâ polyandrous activity make them unique among all other paper wasps.


Since a large set of nests will fail during the nesting season, foundresses constrained by the limited nesting season are forced to attempt female usurpation, where females take over conspecific nests. Thus, nests often have multiple unrelated females. The nests are either fully usurped, where the original female leaves; joined, where the original female remains; or both usurped and joined by other female wasps. Usurpers and joiners are not related to the original nest owner, however, but instead were random wasps from the overall population, which differs from other Polistes wasp joiners that always join with relatives.
Usurping and joining are both inferior strategies to founding a new nest and are only fractionally successful, so these strategies are only chosen after nest failure when the breeding female is not a resident of any nest and is searching for alternative reproductive opportunities. In each case of serial female nesting, the original nest owner no longer has control of the nest. In addition, the newcomer will destroy part of the original brood. All new breeding is by the intruder, and kin-selected benefit via raising the new brood is eliminated for the original female's emerging brood.


The average sex ratio of P. biglumis is female biased; however, the specific sex ratio varies from brood to brood from virtually all male to all female. Furthermore, the sex ratios vary temporally as well, and the sex ratios are biased toward females more toward the end of the pre-emergence period. The presence of multiple females also affects the sex ratios, and single matrilineal nests were more male biased than were nests that underwent serial breeding by multiple females. Because foundresses produce a large number of male offspring early on in the season, and nest founders produce similar sex ratios to begin with, a section of the male offspring of the original foundress is culled by usurpers and joiners.


P. biglumis has a haplodiploid sex determination system. All males among a male brood exhibit the relatedness of full brothers, indicating that they are haploid and generally produced by one female. Females, on the other hand, are diploid. Sex ratio analysis indicates that the female producing all of the male workers was the original nest founder.


Nest predation on the wasp is minimal throughout its nesting season; however, when it does occur, it is mainly perpetrated by birds. Nevertheless, nest predation by vertebrates reaches its peak during the pre-emergence period when the nest is empty except for the foundress and is, as a result, undefended. Furthermore, such predation is a major contribution to nest failure. In these cases, often the nest is predated but the foundress survives, which leads to the creation of usurpers and joiners. Unlike with other Polistes species, ants do not often attack the nests of P. biglumis. Accordingly, P. biglumis releases a very reduced amount of anti-ants substance on to the pedicels of the nests. In most Polistes species, this substance is secreted via abdominal glands on pedicels to prevent ant invasion of the comb.


Polistes atrimandibularis is a rare, obligate parasite that permanently invades the nest of the P. biglumis colonies. Its prevalence is highest in relatively cooler P. biglumis habitats in the Alps and is more scarce in their warmer habitats in the Apennines. The parasite wasp queen will invade the nest of the foundress host wasp during the pre-emergence phase when the nest is empty except for the foundress. The parasite wasp destroys all of the host eggs, and then represses the foundress's egg-laying capacity, cutting her productivity in half. As a result, often only the first of the P. biglumis wasp broods will survive, namely the brood that emerged early and escaped destruction by the parasite queen.


The parasite enters the host nest peacefully and submits to the attacks of the foundress, but over time the parasite queen will begin to dominate over the host queen. The parasite queen will co-opt the host workers as well as the host queen to care for her brood by altering their processes of nestmate recognition. Parasite queens will also help care for the larvae toward the end of the colony cycle. She will enter other local colonies of the host species to steal their larvae and pupae. She will use the pupae and larvae of the foreign colony P. biglumis to feed her own larvae in the parasitized nest. Intrusion and survival of the parasite wasp in the host foundress's nest is based largely on its ability to manipulate various components of the recognition system utilized by the host wasp.


Parasite queens have levels of epicuticular hydrocarbons key to recognition that are three to four times less than in host wasps, which facilitates a weaker signal that allows them to insinuate themselves into host colonies. As time progresses, the parasite queen can camouflage her odor as a host wasp; at the point of emergence for the workers, the parasite queen is indistinguishable from the host queen. The adult parasitic offspring have no such mechanism for deception and they have unsaturated epicuticular hydrocarbons specific to their species that do not occur in the host species. However, the different odors of parasite and host species do not affect the acceptance by the host species workers of the parasite brood in parasitized nests. As a result, parasitized colonies do not have a homogeneous odor because parasite offspring have a different odor than hosts.


The survival of the parasite offspring relies on their queen to alter the nest paper from which the new host workers learn nestmate recognition. The parasite wasp impregnates the nest paper with unsaturated, parasite species hydrocarbons so that the emerging host workers learn to recognize both host and parasite broods as nestmates. As a result, newly emerged parasite wasp females will only be accepted in P. biglumis colonies that have already been parasitized. In non-parasitized colonies, they receive highly aggressive responses from host wasps. Thus, the host wasps in parasitized colonies learn a recognition odor template that is more inclusive than the one used by wasps of nonparasitized colonies. This expanded template leads to a far greater error rate in nestmate recognition for the host wasp. The parasitized nest hosts demonstrate an impairment in discrimination, and are much more likely to permit even nonnestmate conspecific individuals. They are also more likely to reject nestmates erroneously as well.",0,26 September 2014, 12 May 2021,57,0,0

31193874,Dinosaur diet and feeding,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_diet_and_feeding,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dinosaur_diet_and_feeding&action=info,"Dinosaur diets and feeding behavior varied widely throughout the clade, including carnivorous, herbivorous, and omnivorous forms.


While studying into the chewing methods of hadrosaurids in 2009, the paleontologists Vincent Williams, Paul Barrett, and Mark Purnell found that hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs. This conclusion was based upon the evenness of scratches on hadrosaur teeth, which suggested the hadrosaur used the same series of jaw motions over and over again. As a result, the study determined that the hadrosaur diet was probably made of leaves and lacked the bulkier items such as twigs or stems, which might have required a different chewing method and created different wear patterns. However, Purnell said these conclusions were less secure than the more conclusive evidence regarding the motion of teeth while chewing.


The hypothesis that hadrosaurs were likely grazers rather than browsers appears to contradict previous findings from preserved stomach contents found in the fossilized guts in previous hadrosaurs studies. The most recent such finding before the publication of the Purnell study was conducted in 2008, when a team led by University of Colorado at Boulder graduate student Justin S. Tweet found a homogeneous accumulation of millimeter-scale leaf fragments in the gut region of a well-preserved partially grown Brachylophosaurus. As a result of that finding, Tweet concluded in September 2008 that the animal was likely a browser, not a grazer. In response to such findings, Purnell said preserved stomach contents are questionable because they do not necessarily represent the usual diet of the animal. The issue remains a subject of debate.


Coprolites (fossilized droppings) of some Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs show that the animals sometimes deliberately ate rotting wood. Wood itself is not nutritious, but decomposing wood would have contained fungi, decomposed wood material and detritus-eating invertebrates, all of which would have been nutritious.


Tyrannosaur tooth marks are the most commonly preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. It is usually not possible to identify tooth marks on bone made by small predatory dinosaurs due to similarities in the denticles on their teeth. However, there are exceptions, like an ornithomimid caudal vertebra that has tooth drag marks attributed to Saurornitholestes and a partial Troodon skeleton with preserved puncture marks. Small bones of small theropods that were preyed upon by larger ones may have been swallowed whole and digested frequently enough to affect their abundance in the fossil record.


In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma they are more likely to be a result of the animal's behavior than fractures obtained during a single injurious event. The distribution of stress fractures also has behavioral significance. Stress fractures to the hand are more likely to result from predatory behavior since injuries to the feet could be obtained while running or migrating. In order to identify stress fractures occurring in the feet of Allosaurus specifically due to predatory behavior, the researchers checked to see if the toes which bore the greatest stress while in motion also had the greatest percentage of stress fractures. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would contact the ground first while a theropod was running it would have borne the most stress and should be most predisposed to suffer stress fractures. The lack of such a bias in the examined fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running, like interaction with prey. They suggested that such injuries could occur as a result of the allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. Contact with struggling prey is also the likely cause of tendon avulsions found in the forelimbs of Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. The authors concluded that the presence of stress fractures provide evidence for ""very active"" predation-based diets rather than obligate scavenging.


Tyrannosaur tooth marks are the most commonly preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions. Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviors may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding.

A. R. Jacobsen published a description of a dentary referred to Saurornitholestes with tooth marks. The dentary is about 12Â cm long and preserves fifteen tooth positions, ten of these have teeth, with five of those teeth fully erupted and intact, two broken but functional as evidenced by the presence of wearfacets, three are only partially erupted. Three toothmarks were visible on the lingual surface of the dentary. Two of the three marks are series of grooves made by the serrations on the maker's teeth.


The first consists of 6-7 parallel grooves within a 4 x 1.3Â mm area beneath the alveolus of the third tooth and angled at forty-five degrees to the dentary's longitudinal axis. The striations are between .37Â mm and .40Â mm thick with cuboidal cross-sections.


The second tooth mark lies between the fifth and sixth alveoli and consists of two smaller grooves separated 1.8 and 1.6Â mm respectively from a larger central groove, with a V-shaped groove beneath it at an angle of sixty degrees to the longitudinal axis of the jaw. The third mark consists of four parallel grooves in a 2 x 2Â mm area on the seventh tooth oriented at ninety degrees to the longitudinal axis of the tooth.



The shape of the preserved serrations are too different from those of Saurornitholestes for the marks to be the result of injuries incurred during intraspecific face biting behaviors. Although the right shape for Dromaeosaurus tooth serrations, the preserved marks are too coarse to have been left by that genus. Although a specific identification cannot be made, the most likely perpetrator would be a juvenile individual of one of the Dinosaur Park Formation's tyrannosaurids, like Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, or Aublysodon. Jacobsen determined that all of the marks on the jawbone were left by the same animal because the serration marks all share the same morphology. 

An ornithomimid caudal vertebra has been discovered that has tooth drag marks attributed to Saurornitholestes.


Deinonychus, along with other similar dromaeosaurs, were suggested to kill prey in a similar manner to modern accipitrid birds of prey, due to the similarities of their grasping talons. The Deinonychus would pin the prey down with its own weight, restrain it with its hind feet talons, and dismember it with its mouth.


In 1966 John Ostrom postulated that the diet of late Cretaceous chasmosaurs such as Triceratops and Torosaurus fed on very resistant and fibrous materials like the fronds of cycad or palm plants. By extension, all Ceratopsids had a shearing dentition and efficient, powerful jaw mechanics that allowed them to feed on tough vegetation. Mallon and Anderson postulated that Ankylosaurs and Ceratopsids may have partitioned the herb layer in the Dinosaur Park Formation, or that Ceratopsid feeding height was slightly higher. As well as suggesting that the Ornithopods might have made room for the passing Ceratopsid herds by rising up to avoid ecological competition. Notably, they could not distinguish centrosaurine and chasmosaurine ecology apart, though it is likely present as in other megaherbivore clades. The results of a NPMANOVA analysis supported the suggestion that Ceratopsids had the strongest bite force of each of the megaherbivore groups, and able to process the toughest plants available. Like Ornithopods and unlike all other dinosaurs, Ceratopsians possessed dental batteries that may have been attributable to their success. In 2019, Mallon noted that stratigraphic overlap in the Dinosaur Park Formation between subfamilial taxa was limited, further supporting chasmosaurine and centrosaurine preferencial differences.",1,15 March 2011, 31 August 2021,78,3,3

3049523,Senanga,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senanga,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Senanga&action=info,"Senanga is the capital of the Senanga District, which is located in the Western Province of Zambia. The town is situated on the eastern bank of the Zambezi River, at the southern end of the Barotse Floodplain. It lies on the main road running parallel to the river from Livingstone and Sesheke to Mongu, which crosses the river by a pontoon ferry about 15Â km (9Â mi) south of Senanga. Recently the Kaunga Lyeti Bridge was completed to cross the Kaunga Lyeti River near the junction to Sioma, traveling from Sesheke and Katima Mulilo. On top of the bridgework, recent road projects (the roads to Mongu and Sesheke) have improved travel conditions and inspired economic confidence and growth.


In addition to the river and floodplain with its wildlife and fishing opportunities, Senanga is about 120Â km (75Â mi) from Sioma Ngwezi National Park and about 80Â km (50Â mi) from Ngonye Falls. It has a hotel and serves as a base for fishing tours by boat. A tall radio mast makes a prominent landmark in the town.


Senanga's location, situated on the Zambezi River, is known for its plentiful fish populations. Each year the town holds the Zambia Sport Fishing Competition, which attracts local and international participants. However, the area is prone to  illegal fishing which is having a major impact on important breeding grounds of nembwe, tigerfish and slidejaw.

15806523,Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meigle_Sculptured_Stone_Museum,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meigle_Sculptured_Stone_Museum&action=info,"The Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum is a permanent exhibition of 27 carved Pictish stones in the centre of the village of Meigle in eastern Scotland. It lies on the A94 road running from Coupar Angus to Forfar. The museum occupies the former parish school, built 1844. The collection of stones implies that an important church was located nearby, or perhaps a monastery. There is an early historical record of the work of Thana, son of Dudabrach, who was at Meigle (recorded as Migdele) in the middle of the 9th century during the reign of King Pherath. Thana was likely to have been a monk serving as a scribe in a local monastery that could have been founded in the 8th century. The stones contained in the museum were all found near Meigle, mostly in the neighbouring churchyard or used in the construction of the old church. The present church building dates to about 1870, the previous building having been destroyed in a fire on 28 March 1869. The stones were rescued by William Galloway immediately after the fire. The stones are Christian monuments to the dead of the Pictish warrior aristocracy, who are depicted on the stones bearing their weapons or hunting.


The museum building was originally the village schoolhouse. The building was purchased by the local laird Sir George Kinloch towards the end of the 19th century in order to protect the symbol stones. In 1936 the museum passed into the ownership of the State, it was renovated after the Second World War and reopened to the public in 1949. The building is Category C listed.


About one third of the stones in the museum are Class II in nature (stones with symbols carved in relief and usually bearing a Christian cross). Most of the stones date to the 9th or 10th century AD and were intended as tombstones. The stones are carved from the local sandstone, which is suitable for fine sculpture. Some stylistic elements of the stones show the influence of Northumbria. The Pictish stones at Meigle have a distinct local style that includes an emphasis on aggressive biting beasts, the decorating of crosses with a diagonal key pattern and the usage of rounded heads on cross-slabs.


The sandstone used to sculpt the monuments is old red sandstone, a relatively soft stone that lends itself to detailed carving but is susceptible to erosion. The monuments are likely to have been worked with iron tools such as chisels, punches and hammers, together with hammerstones and wooden mallets. The sculpted designs may have been copied from painted vellum pattern books.


According to the local records, eight stones were lost before the close of the 19th century, including Meigle 10. Some of the surviving stones are parts of larger monuments and it is probable that other fragments are buried in Meigle churchyard or have been used in the construction of walls. Before being moved into the museum, Meigle 1 and Meigle 2 stood on either side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, in front of a grass-covered mound called Vanora's Grave. Some of the stones appear to have been trimmed and placed near the Grave in the 16th and 17th centuries in order to decorate it.


Meigle 1 is a cross-slab. The stone was originally used as a standing stone two millennia before it was sculpted by the Picts, it has cup and ring marks low down on the back of the stone. The cross is Greek in style, with full circles at each of the four handles between the shaft and the arms. The inside of the cross is decorated with interlace patterns, the cross-point being decorated with spirals. The cross shaft itself is flanked by images of mythical beasts. It has an uncoordinated jumble of symbols arranged around a hunting scene on the other side. Among these are images of a winged figure that perhaps represents a Persian deity and of a kneeling camel, as well as a Pictish Beast, salmon, a serpent and Z-rod, a mirror, a comb, a dog's head, animals and horsemen. This stone originally stood on the west side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 2. Meigle 1 may be the oldest stone at Meigle, possibly carved in the late 8th century.


Meigle 2 stands nearly 2.5 metres (8.2Â ft) high. It has a cross on one side and depicts Daniel in the lions' den on the other. The form of the head of the cross is possibly based on that of a jewelled metal cross and is unique. The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of Passion Week running from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday inclusive. The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument. The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion. Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its top and sides and was probably intended to slot into a screen or wall. Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts King Arthur's wife Guinevere, known locally as Vanora. She was abducted by King Mordred and condemned by Arthur to be torn apart by wild beasts. The monument was said to mark her grave. Meigle 2 was originally located on the east side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave. Apart from the scene representing Daniel, the back of the monument also contains various other sections. These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs. Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth. The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a centaur holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him. The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor. The stone has lost some detail due to erosion, although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.


Meigle 3 dates to the 9th century AD. One side has a cross, with a part of a Pictish double-disc symbol to the left, below the arm. On the other is inscribed a mounted warrior wearing a sword below his cape, the scabbard tipped with a chape. The warrior is seated on a striped saddle cloth and carries a spear in his right hand. Meigle 3 is a low gravestone and the warrior may be a portrait of the deceased person. The stone was cut shorter at least twice in antiquity, its original height may have been 0.6 metres (24Â in).


Meigle 4 is a fragmented cross-slab with the central portion missing, the surviving fragments are masterpieces of sculpture. Animals are carved on either side of the top of the cross, with their heads curving up to bite two animals forming the frame of the design. There is an animal below the left arm of the cross with elaborate entwined tail and horns. Opposite this, below the right arm of the cross, is the upper portion of a person struggling against an animal. The inside of the cross is filled with interlace patterns. The reverse of the monument has tightly packed figures and symbols. A mounted horseman occupies the top of the stone, with  two interlaced serpents behind. Under the horse's hooves is another entwined serpent, a Pictish Beast and another animal, with another horseman behind. A crescent with V rod symbol occupies the lowest portion of the stone.


Meigle 5 has a cross carved in high relief on one side. The base of this Greek-style cross sports the unusual decoration of two animal heads. Each quarter of the background contains a single beast. Meigle 5 is a small monument and was carved as an upright headstone for a grave. The back of the stone depicts a lone horseman with a decorated saddle-cloth. On one edge of the monument are inscribed two symbols; the so-called Pictish Beast and a mirror.


Meigle 6 is the central fragment of a cross-slab. The surviving shaft of the cross is decorated with a diagonal key pattern. The back of the stone has, from top to bottom, a horse and rider, a double disc symbol, a crescent and a dog wearing a collar.


Meigle 7 is the top portion of a rounded cross-slab. The cross is decorated with a diagonal key pattern. The back of the monument has a double disc and Z-rod and a comb.


Meigle 8 is a small fragment measuring 0.22 metres (8.7Â in) across. It has an eroded cross on one side and the upper portion of two animals on the reverse, facing each other with forelegs in the opposing beast's mouth. A symbol above them may represent a tool.


Meigle 9 is a recumbent tombstone. It has a shallow slot in the top and sculpted panels on both long sides. One of the panels depicts a griffin, an interlace pattern, an elongated animal wrapped into a knot and two animals facing each other. The other panel is composed of an animal, a sitting person with his limbs entwined with the legs of a bird, another animal, some spiral patterns and a final section that is badly eroded.


Meigle 10 is now lost. It was a carved rectangular panel depicting a horse pulling a carriage bearing a driver and two passengers, the monument also showed a crouching archer and several beasts. The sculpture probably formed a part of a low church screen, possibly separating the chancel and the nave. The stone had been moved inside the old church for protection and was destroyed in the fire of 1869.


Meigle 11 is another recumbent monument and is the largest of the recumbent stones from Meigle. The long sides of the stone have deeply recessed panels with wide borders that once were decorated but are badly worn. The top of the monument is undecorated and has a wide slot at one end. One side of the stone has the sculpted images of three mounted riders accompanied by a dog, behind them is a humanoid figure with an animal's head and gripping two entwined serpents. The other side of the monument is decorated with two intertwined animals followed by a dog and a bear, one above the other, and an unidentified object. To the right of these is a panel of twelve bosses encircled by serpents. At the extreme right is a wheel of seven bosses set within a frame formed of two upright animals with entwined tails and gripping the extremities of a human figure in their mouths.


Meigle 12 is one of the last monuments from Meigle. It is a recumbent gravestone sculpted with a lozenge pattern along the upper surface and with a fish monster and an animal on one side. The other side has a dog biting the leg of a deer and two bulls charging each other. Both ends of the monument are damaged.


Meigle 13 was a piece of a broken cross-slab, now lost.


Meigle 14 is a fragment of a cross-slab. Another fragment of the same monument was built into the old church and was destroyed in the fire. The surviving fragment of cross is filled with interlace and a diagonal key pattern. The reverse side shows a robed cleric carrying a book and a part of a second similar figure, the lost section had the rest of this second figure and a third figure almost identical to the first, facing in the opposite direction.


Meigle 15 is a fragment from the shaft of a small cross-slab. The shaft of the cross is filled with an interlace pattern, on the left are two fighting beasts, on the right side is another animal biting its own back.


Meigle 16 through to Meigle 19 were all fragments of cross-slabs and are now lost.


Meigle 20 is a fragment from the centre of a cross-slab. The shaft is filled with interlace and the fragment also has the carved image of a rider.


Meigle 21 is a portion of a cross slab. It was tall and narrow, the head of the cross being filled with a diagonal key pattern while the circle of the head was formed by sculpted ropework. The shaft of the cross is decorated with an interwoven pattern.


Meigle 22 is a piece of an architectural frieze bearing a sculpture of what has been identified as either the Pictish form of the Celtic god Cernunnos or else a siren, cross-legged with the entwined legs terminating in fish-tails. The figure is flanked by two animals with prominent claws.


Meigle 23 is a small tombstone with a ringed cross on one side between two seated figures and with two pairs of animals decorating the back. The upper pair of animals have their heads apparently joined together, the lower pair are entwined and each bites the other's tail.


Meigle 24 is one of the lost monuments. It was a small cross-slab.


Meigle 25 is a hogback tombstone dating to the late 10th century. The sides of the monument are decorated with carved rooftiles and the ridge of the recumbent stone is sculpted with a fishtailed beast. The stone tapers at one end, and the sides of the monument together with this tapering end are sculpted with concave-sided roof-tiles. The stone demonstrates stylistic affinities with early hogback stones from the Glasgow area. The ridge of the stone is carved with an elongated beast with its head at the higher end of the monument, the beast has the tail of a fish at the tapering end if the stone. The creature's head is similar to the heads of animals on Meigle 1 and Meigle 5.


Meigle 26 is an exceptionally fine recumbent gravestone. It has a socket at one end to hold a vertical cross or stone. The top of the stone has three coiled snakes wrapped around each other at one end, with a design consisting of twelve bosses in the middle and two sea-horses facing each other at the lower end. The left and right borders are marked with interlace patterns that end in birds' heads at one end, at the other end animal jaws open to frame a hollow slot. The sides of the monument are also decorated; one has a hunting scene and a griffin. The opposite side has depictions of a corpse being consumed by two beasts, four interlaced naked human figures and a further two beasts. The end of the stone is carved with a manticore and a human figure.


Meigle 27 is a piece from a cross slab and depicts a figure sitting in a chair, with his servant sat on the floor behind him.


Meigle 28 is the bottom piece of a broken cross slab, it has a horizontal base panel filled with a spiral pattern, and two vertical panels filled with a diagonal key pattern.


Meigle 29 is a fragment depicting two clerics, one of whom appears to be sitting on a chair. The more complete of the two figures has two shoulder brooches holding the folds of his clothing.


Meigle 30 is a fragment carved with a coiled beast.


Meigle 31 is the upper portion of a cross slab, with interlace pattern flanking the head of the cross.


Meigle 32 is a fragment from a cross slab, containing the left arm of the cross and part of a panel containing spiral patterns.


Meigle 33 is a fragment of sculpture with a circular pattern. It is of later date than the rest of the stones in the museum.


Meigle 34 is a carved fragment with a scroll engraved on it.

Andreeva was a leading artist at the Red Rose Silk Factory in MoscowÂ [ru] from 1946 until 1984.


Andreeva's textile designs for mass production, ""Cubes"", ""Olympicsâ, âUrban Gridâ, âSoviet Sportâ, and âSoviet Cosmos,â were among the most popular prints distributed within Socialist Republics in the 1960s and 1970s and were often published in the magazine Decorative Arts of the USSR (Dekorativnoe Iskusstvo SSSR)Â [ru].


She is also the author of the iconic Soviet optical geometric and floral prints that were presented at the International Textile Exhibitions and even traded by the Soviet government to French and Italian textile industries. Beyond her extensive work for mass production, Andreeva was often called to prepare exclusive designs for governmental purposes. Silk shawls after her drawings were presented Soviet official delegations to the political leaders of other countries as part of cultural diplomacy. Her work âCosmosâ, dedicated to the first man in space Yuri Gagarin, was an official present to the Queen Elizabeth II during Nikita Khrushchevâs first visit to the United Kingdom in 1961. Her design for the World Congress of Women became a symbol of the Fifth World Congress of Women, Moscow, July 24â29, 1963. During the 60s Andreeva created several designs for the International Movie Festival in Moscow. As a decorative artist working on state commissions for festivals and international exhibitions, she was granted more freedom to experiment with techniques and motifs than her fine arts peers.


Her series ""Electrification,"" which included large geometric tapestries, served as the central objects at the All Union Exhibition of the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution at the Saint Petersburg Manege. Her work is also known as the Soviet analogue of Optical Art. Andreeva's designs represented the Soviet textile industry at Expo 1967 in Montreal. Along with Soviet costume designer Alla Levasheva, Andreeva constructed a special exhibition platform of Soviet textile ideas at Expo 1970 in Tokyo.



Andreeva held several key positions in the Artists' Union of the USSR, which she joined in 1946. From 1960 to 1970 she was the head of its Textile and Decorative Arts section. She was also in charge of establishing networks for the textile industry and silk production within the Socialist Bloc. She supervised artistic committees at silk factories in Central Asia, Georgia, Armenia, and the Urals, as well as sanatoriums for the Union.


Andreeva was born in 1917 into a wealthy family of Russian merchants. When the familyâs home was seized by the Red Army, 9 year-old Andreeva fled to Moscow to live with distant relatives.  Prior to entering the Moscow Textile Institute, Andreeva attended the Rabfak School of Workers. She entered the lab of Vladimir Favorsky and Igor Grabar.

44298710,Cross-country skiing (sport),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_(sport),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cross-country_skiing_(sport)&action=info,"The sport of cross-country skiing encompasses a variety of formats for cross-country skiing races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by the International Ski Federation and by various national organizations, such as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) and Cross Country Ski Canada. International competitions include the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, the FIS Cross-Country World Cup, and at the Winter Olympic Games. Such races occur over homologated, groomed courses designed to support classic (in-track) and freestyle events, where the skiers may employ skate skiing. It also encompasses cross-country ski marathon events, sanctioned by the Worldloppet Ski Federation, and cross-country ski orienteering events, sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation. Related forms of competition are biathlon, where competitors race on cross-country skis and stop to shoot at targets with rifles, and paralympic cross-country skiing that allows athletes with disabilities to compete at cross-country skiing with adaptive equipment.


Norwegian army units were skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting in the latter part of the 20th century, technique evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man-made materials as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.


Athletes train to achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and flexibility at different levels of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry land, sometimes on roller skis. The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require endurance, strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.


In 1767 Danish-Norwegian general, Carl Schack Rantzau, codified four classes of  military skiing contests and established prizes for each:


An early record of a public ski competition was for an 1843 event in TromsÃ¸. The announcement called the event a ""wagering race on skis"". A distinct alpine technique emerged around 1900 from how skiing was practiced up until then when Mathias Zdarsky advocated the ""Lilienfelder Ski Method"" as an alternative to the Norwegian technique. In Norwegian, langrenn refers to ""competitive skiing where the goal is to complete a specific distance in pre-set tracks in the shortest possible time"". Alpine skiing competitions (known as hill races) existed in Norway during the 18th and 19th centuries, but were discontinued when the main ski festival in Oslo focused on long races (competitive cross-country skiing) and ski jumping (now known as the Nordic disciplines). The alpine disciplines reemerged in Central Europe around 1920. Ski touring competitions (Norwegian: turrenn) are long-distance cross-country competitions open to the public, competition is usually within age categories.


In the 1800s racers used a single, wooden pole, which was longer and stronger than modern poles, and could be used for braking downhill, as well. In Norway, racing with two poles (""Finland style"") met with resistance, starting in the 1880s, when some race rules forbade them; objections included issues of aestheticsâhow they made skiers ""[waddle] like geese"". As the use of pairs of pole became the norm, materials favored lightness and strength, starting with bamboo, which gave way to fiberglass, used at the 1968 Winter Olympics, aluminum, used at the 1972 Winter Olympics, and ultimately carbon fiber, introduced in 1975.


Skate skiing was introduced to competition in the 20th Century. At the first German ski championship, held at the Feldberg in the Black Forest in 1900, the Norwegian Bjarne Nilssen won the 23Â km cross-country race and was observed using a skating motion while skiingâa technique unknown to the spectators. Johan GrÃ¸ttumsbrÃ¥ten used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof, one of the earliest recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing. This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. Finnish skier Pauli Siitonen developed a variant of the style for marathon or other endurance events in the 1970s by leaving one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski (one-sided skating); this became known as the ""marathon skate"". American skier Bill Koch further developed the marathon skate technique in the late 1970s. Skate skiing became widespread during the 1980s after Koch's success with it in the 1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the technique. Norwegian skier, Ove Aunli, started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style. Skating is most effective on wide, smooth, groomed trails, using fiberglass skis that glide well; it also benefits a stronger athleteâwhich, according to Olav BÃ¸, are the reasons that the technique made a breakthrough in the early 1980s. Athletes widely adopted skating to both sides by the time of the 1985 world championship and it was formally adopted by the FIS in 1986âdespite initial opposition from Norway, the Soviet Union and Finlandâwhile preserving events using only classic technique.


The Winter Olympic Games are a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France and included Nordic skiing (which includes cross-country skiing) among the five principal disciplines. Cross-country events have evolved in the Winter Olympics since 1924, as seen in the following timeline:


The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held annually, including years with Winter Olympic Games. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years.


FIS events include:





A ski marathon is a long-distance, usually point-to-point race, of more than 40 kilometers; some are held concurrent with shorter races and participation is usually open to the public. In Norwegian, such a race is called turrenn (""ski touring race""). Major events have more than 10,000 participants where mass starts often have a modified starting order by groupings of participantsâwho have been judged to be of similar ability, beginning with the elite skiers group and ending with a group of the least experienced skiers.  Skiers can use either classic or skate-skiing techniques, depending on the rules of the race. Awards are usually based on overall placement, placement by sex of athlete, and by age category. There are two major series in this category, the Ski Classics and the Worldloppet.


Ski Classics is a commercially sponsored international long-distance cross-country skiing cup competition, held in Europe. It originated in January 2011. As of the winter of 2015â6, the tour consisted of eight long-distance events, preceded by a prologue of 15Â km and La Sgambeda of 24Â km:


The Worldloppet Ski Federation recognizes twenty ski marathons including those in the Ski Classics series (except La Diagonala and ÃrefjÃ¤llslopet). They recognize those athletes who complete Worldloppet races in 10 different countries, at least one of which has to be on another continent, to qualify as a ""Worldloppet Master"". The organization, sanctioned by FIS, seeks to attract elite racers to its events with the FIS Worldloppet Cup and aims thereby to ""increase media and spectator interest in long distance racing"". Notable races, other than the Ski Classics series include:


Ski orienteering is an orienteering discipline recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. The World Ski Orienteering Championships is organized every odd year and includes sprint, middle and long distance competitions, and a Relay for both men and women. The World Cup is organized every even year. Junior World Ski Orienteering Championships and World Masters Ski Orienteering Championships are organized annually.


Biathlon combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total running distance/time. For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; the skier receives a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules; in any given competition one of the following penalties would apply:


Paralympic cross-country skiing is an adaptation of cross-country skiing for athletes with disabilities. Paralympic cross-country skiing is one of two Nordic skiing disciplines in the Winter Paralympic Games; the other is biathlon. Competition is governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Paralympic cross-country skiing includes standing events, sitting events (for wheelchair users), and events for visually impaired athletes under the rules of the International Paralympic Committee. These are divided into several categories for people who are missing limbs, have amputations, are blind, or have any other physical disability, to continue their sport. The classifications are for:


Cross-country ski competitors employ one of two techniques, according to the event: classic and skating (in freestyle races, where all techniques are allowed). Skiathlon combines the two techniques in one race.


Skis are lighter, narrower and designed to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200Â cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, in the case of classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.


Racing ski poles are usually made from carbon fiber and feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing.


In classic cross-country skiing the skis remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of the skis have a grip section in the middle treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, while the rest of the ski bottom has a glide wax. Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature. Both poles may be used simultaneously (""double-poling"") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding ski. In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the ""diagonal stride""âthe predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes. Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent. With double-poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust, which may be augmented with striding. Double-poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes. On steep uphills fishbone technique can be used.


While skate skiing, the skier provides propulsion on a firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis away from one another at an angle, in a manner similar to ice skating. Skis are waxed with a glide wax over their entire length, making them faster than classic skis. Freestyle events take place on smooth, wide, specially groomed courses. With the skating technique double-poling is usually employed with alternating skating strides or with every skate stride. The following table puts these poling sequences into order according to the speed achieved as a progression of ""gears"". In the lowest gear (rarely used in racing), one is poling on the side of the sliding ski, similar to diagonal stride. In the highest gear, the athlete skates without poles. There are equivalent terms in other languages; for example in Norwegian, skating is likened to paddling or dancing, depending on the tempo.


The primary turns used for racing, are the parallel turn, which is used while descending and can provide braking, and the step turn, which is used for maintaining speed during descents or out of track on flats. The wedge turn (or ""snowplow turn""), is sometimes used for braking and turning.


Countries with cross-country ski teams usually have a strategy for developing promising athletes and programs to encourage participation in the sport, starting at a young age. One example is Cross-Country Ski Canada's ""Long-Term Athlete Development"" program. The program encompasses youth development, training, introduction to competition and improvement of promising athletes with an emphasis on ""stamina (endurance), strength, speed, skill and suppleness (flexibility)"". It covers age groups from toddlers to mature adults, who are able to enjoy and participate in the sport. Similarly, the USSA has an outline of ""Cross Country Athlete Competencies"" that has four phases beginning at 12 years old and under and addressing the 21 and older phase at the top. The program encompasses six ""domains:""


Ski training for the athlete depends on whether the desired specialty emphasizes endurance (marathon) or intensity (mid-distance events). The ""intensity"" theory of ski training uses stress to break down muscles and recovery to build them up stronger than before. In this theory, there are five levels of intensity for training:


Athletes train for each level on a seasonal schedule designed for the targeted events: marathon or mid-distance. Additional aspects of training address aerobic (low-intensity) exerciseâespecially for enduranceâand strength to improve joint flexibility and to minimize the risk of injury. Cross-country ski training occurs throughout the year, including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski-specific muscle fitness.


In its ""Organizing committee handbook"", the FIS covers aspects of race management, including the layout of the competition venue, organization of the events (including scheduling, officiating, and awards), and addressing ancillary factors, such as the role of the media. National handbooks, such as the ""USSA Cross-Country Technical Handbook"" and the ""Cross Country Canada officials manual"", provide further guidance, sometimes specific to their venues.


An important aspect of race preparation is grooming the course to provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. This takes into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the layout of grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.


In its ""Cross-country homologation manual"", the FIS recognizes that fans of the sport wish to follow it on television. With this in mind, the manual addresses how to design the race course and the stadium in a manner that not only enhances the experience of spectators, but of viewers, as wellânot just to show the athletes in action, but to show the ways in which fans enjoy the action. The manual includes considerations of:


A course is expected to test the skier's technical and physical abilities, to be laid out in a manner that takes advantage of the natural terrain, and to provide smooth transitions among uphills, downhills and ""undulating"" terrainâdistributed approximately evenly among the three. The manual advocates that courses present a variety of uphills, varying in lengths and gradients between 6% and 12%, which are arrayed efficiently within the venue. It cites two types of stadium, the horseshoe (preferred for television) and the ""ski in, ski out"" layout. It emphasizes the importance of accommodating television coverage at the start, finish, and exchange zones for equipment or relays. In addition, television coverage requires a variety of facilities to support the activities of the press.


As with other sports, some competitors in cross-country skiing have chosen to enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari IsometsÃ¤, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika MyllylÃ¤ and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used to cover up the use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport.


At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes DÃ¼rr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, JÃ¼rgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition. An Italian court found Tauber and Pinter not guilty in 2012.

It was constructed at several stages between the 18th and 20th centuries.


The first stone of the Church of St. Publius was laid down on 2 August 1733 by Bishop Paul AlphÃ©ran de Bussan, in the presence of Grand Master AntÃ³nio Manoel de Vilhena. The sacristy was completed seven years later and it began to be used as a small church by the inhabitants of the then newly built suburb of Floriana. Construction was complete by 17 January 1768, when the relic of Saint Publius was brought to the church. The original design of the church is attributed to Francesco Marandon. The church was originally part of the parish of St. Paul of Valletta.


The faÃ§ade of the church began to be rebuilt in 1771, and the dome was constructed in 1780. It became a vice-parish in 1776, and the church was consecrated by Bishop Vincenzo Labini on 20 March 1792. It became a parish in March 1844, after a decree was issued by Pope Gregory XVI.


The naves and an oratory were constructed between 1856 and 1861. A new faÃ§ade was built by Nicola Zammit between 1884 and 1890. Two new bell towers were also built in 1889 and 1892. The church's interior was embellished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.


Part of the church's faÃ§ade and its dome were destroyed by aerial bombardment during World War II, when it was hit by bombs on 3â4 March and 28 April 1942 and sixteen people were killed. The nearby Sarria Church became a temporary parish church until the Church of St. Publius was reopened on 10 December 1944. Reconstruction of the church was carried out by the architect Gustav Vincenti, and it was completed in the late 1950s. The interior was embellished in the following decades, being fully completed in the early 1990s.


The church is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.


The faÃ§ade of the Church of St. Publius consists of a neoclassical portico topped by a triangular pediment, flanked by a bell tower on either side. A statue of Christ the King stands on the top of the faÃ§ade. The church has a cruciform plan with a dome and a richly decorated interior.


The altarpiece showing the martyrdom of Publius dates back to 1773, and it is the work of Antoine de Favray and his pupil Filippo Vincenzo Pace. The ceiling is decorated by paintings depicting Saint Paul's shipwreck and his stay in Malta. Several other paintings are also found in the church, including works by Giuseppe CalÃ¬, Emvin Cremona and many other artists.


The titular statue of St. Publius was completed in 1811 by the sculptor Vincenzo Dimech.",1,29 May 2016, 28 January 2021,20,0,0

Prosopis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It contains around 45 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Western Asia, and South Asia. They often thrive in arid soil and are resistant to drought, on occasion developing extremely deep root systems. Their wood is usually hard, dense and durable. Their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar. The generic name means ""burdock"" in late Latin and originated in the Greek language.


Prosopis species have been found to contain 5-hydroxytryptamine, apigenin, isorhamnetin-3-diglucoside, l-arabinose, quercetin, tannin, and tryptamine.


The tannins present in Prosopis species are of the pyrogallotannin and pyrocatecollic types. The tannins are mainly found in the bark and wood while their concentration in the pods is low.


Some species, such as P. africana or P. velutina, produce a gum (mesquite gum).


The species Prosopis pallida was introduced to Hawaii in 1828 and now dominates many of the drier coastal parts of the islands, where it is called the kiawe tree and is a prime source of monofloral honey production.


In Australia, invasive Prosopis species are causing severe economic and environmental damage. With their thorns and many low branches, Prosopis shrubs form impenetrable thickets which prevent cattle from accessing watering holes, etc. They also take over pastoral grasslands and suck up scarce water. Prosopis species cause land erosion due to loss of grassland that are habitats for native plants and animals. Prosopis thickets also provide shelter for feral animals such as pigs and cats.


For more information on invasiveness of mesquite species, see Prosopis glandulosa and Prosopis juliflora.


Eradicating Prosopis is difficult because the plant's bud regeneration zone can extend down to 6Â in (150Â mm) below ground level; the tree can regenerate from a piece of root left in the soil. Some herbicides are not effective or only partially effective against mesquite. Spray techniques for removal, while effective against short-term regrowth, are expensive, costing more than $70/acre ($170/hectare) in the USA. Removing large trees requires tracked equipment;  costs can approach $2,000 per acre. In Australia, several techniques are used to remove Prosopis.",7,14 October 2003, 11 March 2021,155,0,0

Viewed narrowly, digital content includes popular media types, while a broader approach considers any type of digital information (e. g. digitally updated weather forecasts, GPS maps, and so on) as digital content. 


Digital content has increased as more households have accessed the Internet. Expanded access has made it easier for people to receive their news and watch TV online, challenging the popularity of traditional platforms. Increased access to the Internet has also led to the mass publication of digital content through individuals in the form of eBooks, blog posts, and even Facebook posts.


At the beginning of the Digital Revolution, computers facilitated the discovery, retrieval, and creation of new information in every field of human knowledge. As information became increasingly more accessible, the Digital Revolution also facilitated the creation of digital content. Despite an evolution to digital technology, which occurred somewhere between the late 1950s and 1970s, distribution of digital content did not begin until the late 1990s with the rise in popularity of the Internet.


In the past, digital content was primarily distributed through computers and the Internet, yet methods of distribution are rapidly changing as the Digital Revolution brings new channels, such as mobile apps and eBooks. These new technologies will create challenges for content creators, as they determine the best channel to bring content to their consumers. 


Despite the benefits, new technologies have created new intellectual property issues. Users can easily share, modify, and redistribute content outside of the creator's control. While new technologies have made digital content available to large audiences, managing copyright and limiting content movement will continue to be an issue that digital content creators face in the future.


Examples include:


In order to have access to more premium digital goods, consumers usually have to pay an upfront charge for digital content, or a subscription based fee.


According to a report done by IHS Inc. in 2013, the global consumer spending on digital content grew to over $57 billion in 2013, which was up almost 30% from $44 billion in 2012.  In past years, the US has always been a leader in consumer expenditure on digital content, but as of 2013, many countries have emerged with great consumer expenditure. South Korea's overall digital spend per capita is now greater than the US.


Not all digital content is purchasable, and is simply anything published digitally. This would include:


Digital content businesses can include news, information, and entertainment distributed over the Internet and consumed digitally by both consumers and businesses.  Based on revenue, the leading digital businesses are ranked Google, China Mobile, Bloomberg, Reed Elsevier, and Apple.  The 50 companies with the highest revenue are split between those offering free and paid digital content, but these top 50 companies combined generate revenue of $150 billion.


Educational Opportunities
Programs such as CUNY's Macaulay Honors College in their New Media Lab run by industry professional Robert Small is set up to train and introduce students to the various disciplines within the digital content industry.  The goal is to offer information and access to professional work opportunities.  They also explore within an incubator how to create businesses and start ups within the world of digital content. There are many educational events in support of choosing digital content as a career.",0,25 November 2011, 14 May 2021,181,0,0

The company has four standalone boutiques in the US, and two in Japan. Since 2012, it has been owned by Mitsui. The Paul Stuart logo is Dink Stover sitting on the Yale fence. Paul Stuart has been described as a blend of âSavile Row, Connecticut living and the concrete canyons of New York.â Its creative director is Ralph Auriemma.


The company was helmed by the legendary merchant and CEO Clifford Grodd from 1958 until his death in 2010. The retailer remained a privately-held family business until December 2012, when it was sold to its long-time Japanese partners, Mitsui.


In fall 2007, Paul Stuart launched its Phineas Cole range, which is clothing with a slimmer silhouette. 
Paulette Garafalo, formerly of Brooks Brothers and Hickey Freeman, became CEO of Paul Stuart on June 14, 2016, marking the first time someone unrelated to the Ostrove family led the company.
In 2019, the company began offering a lower-priced made-to-measure service branded as customLAB, and a luxury MTM jeans service branded as denimBAR. In 2019, the company celebrated the redesign of its omnichannel e-commerce website with home delivery via vintage Packard automobile.


Paul Stuart has shops in New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, Osaka and Tokyo.


Since 1938, the original New York City flagship store has been located at the corner of Madison Avenue and 45th Street. It has grown to 60,000 square feet (5,600Â m2) and remains the company's largest store.


In the fall of 2008, Paul Stuart relocated its Chicago store from the John Hancock Center on Michigan Avenue to Oak Street. In the spring of 2011, Paul Stuart opened a second Chicago location in The Loop, at the corner of LaSalle Street and Adams Street in the historic Continental and Commercial National Bank building designed by Daniel Burnham, currently anchored by JW Marriott Hotels.

The Oneida Institute was a short-lived (1827â1843) but highly influential school that was a national leader in the emerging abolitionism movement. It was the most radical school in the country, the first at which black men were just as welcome as whites. ""Oneida was the seed of Lane Theological Seminary, Western Reserve College, Oberlin and Knox colleges."":â37â


The Oneida Institute was located near Utica, in the village of Whitesboro, New York, town of Whitestown, Oneida County, New York. It was founded in 1827 by George Washington Gale as the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry.:â32â His former teacher (in the Addison County Grammar School, Middlebury, Vermont, 1807â1808) John Frost,:â38â now a Presbyterian minister in Whitesboro with a wealthy wife â daughter of Thomas Ruggles Gold, â was the primary partner in setting up the institute. They raised $20,000, a significant part of which was from the philanthropist and abolitionist brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan;:â42â Arthur had helped various western institutions, to the extent of tens of thousands of dollars, ""but his favorite among them was Oneida Institute"".:â38â With this they bought land and began construction of the buildings. The Institute occupied ""more than 100 acres (40Â ha) bordered by Main Street and the Mohawk River and by Ellis and Ablett Avenues in Whitesboro village.""


The first student movement in the country, the Lane Rebels, began at Oneida. A contingent of about 24, with an acknowledged leader (Theodore Dwight Weld), left Oneida for Lane and then, more publicly, soon left Lane for Oberlin. Oneida's first president, Gale, founded Knox Manual Labor Institute, later Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois. Oneida hired its second president, Beriah Green, from Oberlin's competitor in northeast Ohio, Western Reserve College. All of this is very much linked to the explosively emerging topic of abolitionism.


The Institute opened in May 1827 with 2 instructors, Gale and Peletiah Rawson, the latter a Hamilton College graduate and engineer that had worked on the just-completed Erie Canal.:â42â There were initially 20 students,:â11â including most of the 7 that had been working in exchange for instruction on Gale's farm in Western, New York, a pilot project.:â42â43â Theodore Weld, who would become the leader of the students, was among them.:â11â Enrollment soon grew to 100,:â43â and by 1830, 500 applicants were turned away for lack of space.:â35â It was chartered in 1829 as the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry.:â35â Through Frost, it was ""intimately connected"" with the Presbyterian church of Whitesboro.:â79â


Oneida was the first and leading American example of the manual labor college, which Gale thought he had originated, although there were earlier examples.:â34â35â His goal was to supplement study with the physical and spiritual or psychological benefits of exercise; for the time this was an innovative and informed position. By ""unit[ing] classical education with agricultural, horticultural, and mechanical labor,"":â33â Gale was also trying to make education more affordable. ""Students worked on the farm, or in the carpenter, trunk and harness-making shops"";:â43â a printing shop was added later. The first year, floods destroyed the crops, but the second year, students


produced fifty cords of wood, thirty barrels of cider, seven hundred bushels of corn, four hundred of potatoes, one hundred of oats, twenty-five of beans, thirty tons of hay, and eighty bushels of onionsâthe whole valued at $1000 [equivalent to $24,303 in 2020].:â43â

""Religious fervor was kept at a white heat. Studies were interrupted to hold protracted revival meetings."":â43â Gale replaced the study of Latin and Classical Greek with Hebrew and Biblical Greek.:â42â The charismatic, influential Christian revivalist Charles Finney had been a student of Gale prior to Oneida, and Gale sought at Oneida to train students ""as emissaries of the new revivalism"".:â32â ""The result was a large crop of crusaders and reformers, who were later turned loose to fulminate against drink, slavery, Sabbath breaking, [and] irreligion, some of whom became famous in their proseletyzing fields."":â43â


Gale ""lacked the qualities of a leader"".:â32â In the summer of 1833 a debate on colonization led to the formation of a colonization and an anti-slavery society.:â5â


Student dissatisfaction led to a mass walk-out in 1832, with about 24 students leaving for Lane, then Oberlin. Gale soon desired to be replaced; he went to Illinois, where he began Galesburg, Illinois, and the Knox Manual Labor College, which in 1857 became Knox College. Gale left the institute with ""fiscal problems"", saddled with ""numerous financial obligations"".:â93â


It was an heroic age â an age in which principles of truth were striving for recognition in the lives of those bold enough to be right, rather than popular. Among the few institutions that dared to risk their success upon the carrying out of ideas hostile in their time, was the Oneida Institute, at Whitesboro, New York. It was the hot-bed of radicalism as it existed at that day. Many of its ideas have become a part of the national lifeÂ ; while others are still on debatable ground. There was a heavy brain at its head; and there were great men back of it.:â39â40â

After a search, the trustees settled on abolitionist firebrand Beriah Green, who started in 1833, and ""for whom Gale had nothing but scorn"".:â44â The school was dominated by Green's personality and was known as ""President Green's school"".:â67â


Green ""revamped Oneida's curriculum by giving greater attention to the study of ethics or moral philosophy than was the case during Gale's tenure, or indeed at most American colleges in the 1830s."" He replaced the study of Latin and classical Greek with Hebrew and New Testament Greek.:â66â


In 1836 (another source says 1838), in the ""juvenile department"", William Whipple Warren studied arithmetic, English grammar, geography, and ""the Greek of Matthew's gospel"". In 1843, a letter seeking funds gives the ""Course of Study"" as ""Greek, Hebrew, arithmetic, bookkeeping, algebra, anatomy, physiology, geometry, natural philosophy [studying nature, forerunner of science], natural theology, evidences of Christianity, political economy, science of government, exercises in declamation and composition."":â2â


For admittance to the school, Green stated: 


It is expected of those who would enjoy the advantages offered at the Oneida Institute, that they furnish trustworthy testimonials of good mental and moral character, be competent to teach a common English school, and able to recite the Greek Grammar, and profess the design of pursuing our course of study fully. These advantages we do not confine to those who may expect ultimately to enter the ministry.:â258â

The curriculum was in line with Green's goal of training abolitionist activists, which he believed was what Christianity mandated. Abolitionism was a ""sacred vocation"".:â68â The Institute under Green was ""an abolition college"", ""a hotbed of anti-slavery activity,"":â44â ""abolitionist to the core, more so than any other American college."":â46â Oneida and Whitestown Anti-Slavery Societies were soon formed, declaring that slavery was not just an evil, it was a crime and a sin.


Green accepted the job on two conditions: that he be allowed to preach ""immediatism"", the immediate emancipation of slaves, and that it be allowed to admit African-American students. These were agreed to. Prior to Green, there had not been any Black students at Oneida; so far as is known, none had applied.


In 1833, allowing African-American students into educational institutions alongside whites was controversial at best, and aroused bitter, even violent opposition. (Even schools for black students only could be the object of violence.:â212â) While there had been one African-American graduate each from Amherst, Bowdoin, and Middlebury, these were exceptional cases.:â50â The Noyes Academy in New Hampshire was destroyed in 1835 after it admitted African-American students; farmers with ninety yoke of oxen dragged the Academy building to a corner of the Common, leaving it ""shattered, mutilated, inwardly beyond reparation almost."":â267â Four of its students then enrolled at Oneida.:â54â The city of New Haven in 1831 unexpectedly and decisively prevented the setting up of ""a new college for the instruction of colored youth"",:â11â of which there was none in United States.:â25â28,â35â:â50â (See Simeon Jocelyn.) In New York, the American Colonization Society would not allow even a lecture series for blacks on history. The Canterbury Female Boarding School, in Canterbury, Connecticut, was forced to close after it admitted one African-American girl in 1832, and the school for ""young ladies and little misses of color"" which replaced it was met with such escalating violence from the townspeople that director Prudence Crandall was forced to close it out of concern for the students' safety. New-York Central College was forced to close in part because of local hostility to education of African Americans, and even more so to African-American professors.:â362â


A month before Green's arrival in August 1832, 35 students formed an antislavery society on immediatist principles, the first in New York State. 34 students formed a colonization society;:â36â colonization was not in favor of full emancipation, and thought the best place for free blacks was ""back to Africa"", e.g. Liberia.


In his inaugural address, Green called for ""immediate, unconditional, and uncompensated emancipation"". Compensated emancipation meant that owners of released slaves would be compensated for the loss of their ""property"", as they were, in part, when the District of Columbia's slaves were emancipated in 1862.


In this environment Oneida admitted African-American students, the first college in the country to admit them without restrictions.:âxiiiâ According to alumnus Alexander Crummell, there was ""perfect equality"" between the black and white students.:â49â


There were generally 10â14 ""colored students"". In 1840, ""including Indian blood"", there were 20.:â3â


When Green became president, the institute was in debt.:â2â American abolitionists, including Gerrit Smith, pledged $65,000 (equivalent to $1,580,000 in 2020) towards the support of the institute, although because of the Panic of 1837 not all were able to fulfill their pledges. The Panic left the Institute $9,000 in debt.:â2â


Before 1840, there were an average of 100 students. After incurring the large debt, which Charles Stuart called ""embarrassments"", ""in 1841 the instructors relinquished nearly all of their salaries"", and enrollment was cut to 25; the following year, 50â75. Just before closure, counting the President there were four professors, ""and an able financier"".:â2â


""[T]he education societies withdrew their aid from its students, because its course of study substituted Hebrew for Latin, and it was called an Institute, not an Academy, College, or Theological School. And the charges that have been sung among the pro-slavery influences of church and state around it, on the 'nigger school' cannot well be numbered."":â3â4â According to Sernett, the Presbyterian Education Society and the American Education Society ""struck Oneida Institute from its list of approved schools"" in 1834.:â41,â209â Another source says this was in 1839.:â55â


In 1836, the New York Senate passed a resolution ""directing the Committee on Literature [schools] to inquire into the propriety of denying the Oneida Institute all participation in the Benefits of the Literature Fund."" This was because it was ""regarded as the hot-bed of sedition, [and] that Beriah Green, the principal, had been active and successful in propagating the doctrines of abolitionism."" The Legislature took no action after more than 150 people met to protest and to demand academic freedom.:â54â55â


During 1833â1834 Frost's employment is specified as ""Agent, Oneida Institute"". By 1835 Frost had left Whitesboro for a pulpit in Elmira, (which he helped make an Underground Railroad center). His replacement, David Ogden, was not an abolitionist. This led to a withdrawal from the Whitesboro Presbyterian Church of ""seventy-one communicant members, including most of the elders"", to form a new Congregational church under Green's direction.:â87â As a result, ""Green and his school [were left] with fewer and fewer friends""; he could no longer turn to churches for funding.:â89â


The Oneida Institute ceased operations in 1843.:â105â One factor was the New York Anti-Slavery Society's failure to pay the institute $2000 for the printing costs of their paper Friend of Man,:â94â but even if it had, there was no way to make the Institute financially viable. According to Dana Bigelow, ""Green left the institution a wreck"". He identifies the causes of its failure as three: first, the manual labor scheme; ""unskilled labor was found to be unprofitable"". (The $1000 mentioned above did not cover costs.) Second, replacing the classics with the Bible; ""this did much to disconnect the institution with the general theory and habit of culture in the country and to stamp it with a certain reputation of singularity which could not fail to be in many ways disastrous."" Finally, the treating of black and white students equally, and its ""iconoclastic zeal for the overthrow of social institutions and interests"", led to ""much popular odium"".:â208â209â


""Oneida was the seed of Lane Theological Seminary [c. 1830], Western Reserve University , Oberlin  and Knox College ."":â37â Through the Whitestown Seminary it is also a predecessor of Bates College (1855).:â66â A graduate, William G. Allen, became the second African-American professor in the country at nearby New-York Central College, which also admitted African-American students and was also short-lived.


Theodore Dwight Weld, who had studied at Oneida from 1827 to 1830, was dissatisfied with Gale's leadership. He led a 1833 exodus of ""Oneida boys...disenchanted with Gale's leadership and the lack of regular theological courses""; they rafted down the French and Allegheny rivers to Cincinnati, and constituted 24 of the 40 members of the Lane Seminary's first theological class.:â40â


To satisfy debts its facilities were sold to the Free Will Baptists, who created the Whitestown Seminary in 1844. A condition of the sale was that the new seminary admit students of ""all colors"".:â105â Several Oneida Institute students enrolled.:â106â Whitestown Seminary merged with the Cobb Divinity School to form the Free Will Baptist Bible School, which moved to the New Hampton Institute in 1854 before moving to Bates College in 1870 and eventually merging the school's religion department.


A predecessor was the school of H. H. Kellog, in Clinton. Elizabeth, ""lady principal"", daughter of Robert Everett, two of whose brothers attended the Oneida Institute, married John Jay Butler.:â533â



Green's policy was to accept any qualified student that applied. As a result, student Grinnell described the student body as ""a motley company"", consisting of: 

emancipators' boys from Cuba; mulattoes; a Spanish student [from Minorca]; an Indian named Kunkapot; black men who had served as sailors, or as city hackmen [drivers], also the purest Africans escaped from slavery; sons of American radicals; Bible students scanning Hebrew verse with ease, in the place of Latin odes; enthusiasts, plowboys and printers; also real students of elegant tastes, captured by the genius of President Green.:â51â

46705794,Lambert Simnel (horse),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_Simnel_(horse),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lambert_Simnel_(horse)&action=info,"Lambert Simnel (1938â1952) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire, who raced during World War II and was best known for winning the classic 2000 Guineas in 1941. As a two-year-old he won once and finished second in the Dewhurst Stakes In the following spring he won the 2000 Guineas, beating a field which included the subsequent classic winners Owen Tudor and Sun Castle. He was beaten when favourite for the Derby and finished unplaced in the St Leger. He won once as a four-year-old in 1942 before being retired to stud. He stood as a breeding stallion in England and Argentina with limited success before his death in 1952.


Lambert Simnel was a bay horse, bred by his owner Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Fair Trial who won the Queen Anne Stakes in 1935 before becoming a highly successful breeding stallion. His other progeny included the classic winners Court Martial, Festoon, and Palestine. Lambert Simnel's dam, Simnel was a moderate racehorse with a relatively undistinguished pedigree but was distantly related to Stargrass who became the grand-dam of the Exbury.


Lambert Simnel's racing career took place during World War II. During the war, horse racing in Britain was subject to many restrictions. Several major racecourses, including Epsom and Doncaster, were closed for the duration of the conflict, either for safety reasons, or because they were being used by the military. Many important races were rescheduled to new dates and venues, often at short notice, and all five of the Classics were usually run at Newmarket.


The Duke of Westminster named his colt after a fifteenth century pretender and sent him into training with Fred Templeman at Lambourn in Berkshire. Templeman had been a successful jockey, riding major winners including Grand Parade and Irish Elegance before setting up as a trainer in 1921.


As a two-year-old, Lambert Simnel ran three times and won one race. He produced his most notable effort when finishing second to the filly Fettes in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse.


On 30 April 1941, Lambert Simnel contested the 133rd running of the 2000 Guineas which was run over the July course at Newmarket rather than its traditional home on the Rowley Mile. He was ridden by Charlie Elliott and started at odds of 10/1 in a field of nineteen runners with the Fred Darling-trained Owen Tudor being made favourite. Lambert Simnel won by two lengths from Morogoro (the favourite's stable companion), with Sun Castle a length and a half away in third and Owen Tudor in fifth.


In the New Derby, run over one and a half miles at the same course on 18 June, Lambert Simnel started 4/1 favourite ahead of Sun Castle and Morogoro in a twenty-runner field. He never looked likely to win and finished tenth behind Owen Tudor. Lambert Simnel was brought back in distance for the one-mile St James's Palace Stakes, run that year at Newmarket, and produced a better effort, finishing second to Orthodox. With Doncaster Racecourse unavailable, a substitute ""New St Leger"" was run over one and three quarter miles at Manchester on 6 September. Lambert Simnel finished unplaced behind Sun Castle.


At the end of the 1941 season, Lambert Simnel was offered for sale and bought for 2,500 guineas by Mrs H. G. Thurston.


Lambert Simnel remained in training as a four-year-old and won one of his two races.

630613,Alstom Citadis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alstom_Citadis,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alstom_Citadis&action=info,"The Alstom Citadis is a family of low-floor trams (streetcars) and light rail vehicles built by Alstom. As of 2017[update], over 2,300 Citadis trams have been sold and 1,800 tramways are in revenue service throughout the world, with operations in all six inhabited continents. An evolution of Alstom's earlier TFS vehicle, most Citadis vehicles are made in Alstom's factories in La Rochelle, Reichshoffen and Valenciennes, France, and in Barcelona, Spain, and Annaba, Algeria.


The Citadis family includes both partial and fully low-floor trams and LRVs, in versions with three (20x), five (30x), seven (40x), and nine (50x) sections. It comprises the following standard variants:


Citadis X00:


Citadis X01 (First generation):


Citadis X02 (Second generation):


Citadis X03 (Third generation):


Citadis X04 (Fourth generation):


Citadis X05 (Fifth generation):


Like most trams, Citadis vehicles are usually powered by overhead electric wires collected by a pantograph, but the trams in several places do not use pantograph current collection entirely. Other places, such as Toronto, use a trolley pole.


The most popular solution is Alstom's proprietary ground-level power supply (APS, first used in Bordeaux and subsequently in Angers, Reims, Orleans, Tours, Dubai, Rio, and Sydney), consisting of a type of third rail which is only powered while it is completely covered by a tram so that there is no risk of a person or animal coming into contact with a live rail. On the networks in France and in Sydney, the trams switch to conventional overhead wires in outer areas, but the Dubai vehicles are the first to employ APS for its entire passenger length (although they are still equipped with pantographs for use in the maintenance depot).


Another option is to use on-board batteries to store electrical power, allowing brief periods of catenary-free operation without the need to install special infrastructure. The Citadis trams in Nice operate off a set of nickel metallic hydride batteries in two large open spaces where overhead wires would be an eyesore. This has since been superseded by a supercapacitor-based energy storage system (SRS) which is in use in Rio de Janeiro (alongside APS) and along a new line in Nice. The Regio-Citadis can also be built as a dual-voltage or electro-diesel vehicle with various configurations.

The region had an area of 308.7 square kilometres (119.2Â sqÂ mi) and the administrative center in the city of Hertsa. It was one of the three raions of Ukraine with the majority of ethnic Romanian population. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Chernivtsi Oblast to three. The area of Hertsa Raion was merged into Chernivtsi Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 33,175 (2020 est.)


At the time of disestablishment, the raion consisted of two hromadas, Hertsa urban hromada with the administration in Hertsa and Ostrytsia rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Ostrytsia.


The Hertsa region was part of the Principality of Moldavia since its founding in the 14th century and after the union of Moldavia with Wallachia in 1859 it became part of Romania, which gained its formal independence in 1877.


The region was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 following the signing of the MolotovâRibbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, and was added to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was recaptured by Romania in 1941 in the course of Axis attack on the Soviet Union in the Second World War, but was recaptured again by the Soviet Army in 1944.  The annexation was confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties in 1947 between the USSR and the Communist Romania.


The fact that neither the secret protocol (appendix) of the MolotovâRibbentrop Pact, which specified the expansionist claims of both sides, nor the June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum demanding from Romania the adjacent territory of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia included Hertsa makes the capture by the Soviets controversial in Romania. Furthermore, unlike Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the region had not been a part of Imperial Russia or Austria-Hungary before World War I, but had been a part of Romania and one of its predecessor states, Moldavia, before that.


In 1962, the raion was merged into Hlyboka Raion, and in 1991, was reinstated again.


In 1930, the region had a population of 30,082, of which 27,919 (92.8%) Romanians, 1,931 (6.4%) Jews and 232 (0.8%) people of other ethnicities.


In 2001, the population of Hertsa Raion was 32,316, of which 91.4% Romanians, 5.0% Ukrainians, 2.3% Moldovans, 0.9% Russians and 0.3% of other ethnicities (see: Ukrainian Census, 2001).


Hertsa Raion was composed of 1 city and 13 incorporated localities, containing a total of 24 villages (Romanian names listed in brackets):

KROC-FM went on-the-air at 106.9Â MHz in 1965 with a easy listening and classical music touch.But the hybrid format was dropped in 1967 which resulted in a longtime simulcast with KROC-AM until the mid-1970s, then a brand new automated MOR format called The Great Entertainers was KROC-FM's next format separating from KROC-AM and that was way before it went to become a highly successful Top 40/CHR format, under their all brand spanking new moniker as FM 107 KROC. In the 1950s, the owners launched a television station (KROC-TV), though that is now operated separately by Quincy Newspapers as KTTC channel 10.


On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus stations, including KROC-FM, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management.

The house has a large addition constructed in the early 19th century. The name was derived from the many lilac bushes on the property.


The original owner was Morten Garret who bought a 151-acre (61Â ha) plot of land in 1711. The farmhouse was built in two sections with the southern section constructed by Garret sometime shortly after the land was purchased. The attached section was added by Garret's descendants in 1832, as an extension from the northeast wall of the original house.


The house was owned by the Garret family until the city purchased the land in 1869 to expand Fairmount Park. A rowing club called the University Barge Club began using the house sometime after 1871 as its upstream social clubhouse along the Schuylkill River. In the 1990s, the house was used as a halfway house for juveniles.


As of 2018[update], a sign at the driveway entrance to the house stated Outward BoundâLilac Houseâ3600 Greenland Drive. The same organization leases and maintains the Porter's House of the demolished Sedgeley Mansion, also in Fairmount Park on the opposite side of the river.


The Lilacs house is registered on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places and is an inventoried structure within the Fairmount Park Historic District entry on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was the eleventh race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.


The 53-lap race was won by Frenchman Jacques Laffite, driving a Talbot Ligier-Matra. Compatriot RenÃ© Arnoux finished second in a Renault, having started from pole position, with Brazilian Nelson Piquet third in a Brabham-Ford. Piquet moved to within six points of Drivers' Championship leader, Argentine Carlos Reutemann, who finished fifth in his Williams-Ford.


In qualifying, just like the previous year, it was an all-French front row; RenÃ© Arnoux planted his turbocharged Renault on pole, alongside his teammate Alain Prost. Next was Gilles Villeneuve in his turbocharged Ferrari, Jacques Laffite in the Talbot Ligier, Carlos Reutemann and Alan Jones in the Williams cars were 5th and 6th, then Nelson Piquet in a Brabham and then Didier Pironi in the other turbocharged Ferrari.


The Fittipaldi team was not present because they did not have enough engines.


At the start, Villeneuve got the jump on the two Renaults and led into the Hella-Licht chicane. On the next lap, Prost passed Villeneuve into the Hella-Licht; Villeneuve tried to outbrake Prost but he locked up solid and went into some runoff area; as did Reutemann. Both the Canadian and Argentine drivers were able to rejoin, but with time lost.


At the high-speed Ãsterreichring, a power advantage paid dividends. Prost and Arnoux were able to pull away from the rest of the field. Around lap 4, Pironi (who had made a lightning start from 8th on the grid) was running 3rd, and Laffite, Piquet, Jones and eventually Reutemann had caught up to Pironi. None of them could find a way past, and were held up by Pironi for a number of laps. In a similar situation to the Spanish Grand Prix earlier in the year, the Ferrari had more power than any of the cars behind it did, but its handling was way worse; so they were able to stay with the Ferrari. The 5 drivers battled it out, with Piquet, Laffite, Jones and Reutemann keeping with and desperately trying to find a way past Pironi, but not being able to because of the Ferrari's power pulling away on the straights; made more difficult by the fact that the scenic Ãsterreichring was made up almost entirely of long corners and straights.


Villeneuve crashed heavily at the Bosch-Kurve on lap 12, and finally, Laffite, having already passed Piquet, managed to outbrake Pironi into the first of the Texaco bends, and then the rest of the three drivers got by as well. Prost retired from the lead with damaged suspension, and Laffite then charged after Arnoux, passing him at the second of the 2 Texaco Bends. Laffite was to hold the lead until the end, and the poor performance of the Ferrari in relation to other cars meant that Pironi managed to hold up more cars.


Laffite crossed the line, followed by Arnoux, Piquet, Jones, Reutemann (who coasted over the finish line with a dead engine) and John Watson in the carbon-fibre McLaren.",0,1 November 2004, 21 August 2021,103,0,0

The see was founded in 967 by Emperor Otto I at the same time in the same manner as those of Meissen and Zeitz (from 1029: Naumburg), all suffragan dioceses of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg as part of a plan to bind the adjacent Slavic (""Wendish"") lands in the Saxon Eastern March beyond the Saale River more closely to the Holy Roman Empire.


The prince-bishopric was re-established by King Henry II of Germany in 1004. It then covered a considerable small territory stretching from the Saale up to the Mulde River and the Margraviate of Meissen in the east.


About 919 Otto's father King Henry the Fowler had a Kaiserpfalz erected in Merseburg in the Eastphalian Hassegau, hometown of his first wife Hatheburg of Merseburg. The establishment of the diocese traced back to a vow Otto took before his victory against the Hungarians at the Battle of Lechfeld on Saint Laurence day, 10 August 955. Confirmed by Pope John XIII at the 968 synod in Ravenna, the first Merseburg bishop was Boso, a Bavarian monk descending from St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg (Ratisbon), already distinguished by his missionary labours among the pagan Sorbs.


Boso's successor Gisilher, a confidant of the new Emperor Otto II, from 971 procured the suppression of the see in favour of his aims to become Archbishop of Magdeburg, finally reached through the Emperor's power over Pope Benedict VII in 981. However this step was clearly against the interests of the Church and the position of Magdeburg archbishopric was decisively enfeebled after the Great Slav Rising of 983, therefore the dissolution was revoked by the papacy in 998 or early in 999 at a Roman synod. Upon Archbishop Gisilher's death in 1004, King Henry II re-established the prince-bishopric; the diocese did not, however, recover all its former territory, and was now almost exclusively a missionary jurisdiction among the Sorbs, who were not fully converted to Christianity until the middle of the 12th century.


Under Bishop Thietmar (1009-1018) the erection of Merseburg Cathedral began, it was consecrated in 1021 in presence of Emperor Henry II. During the Investiture Controversy the Merseburg bishops sided with Pope Gregory VII and also joined the Great Saxon Revolt, which, however, could not stop the dwindling importance of the small diocese. From the 13th century onwards, the bishops had to deal with rising power of the Meissen margraves of the Wettin dynasty, from  1423 Electors of Saxony, who by denying Merseburg's Imperial immediacy attempted to acquire the overlordship. By the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig the Wettins allocated the protectorate over Merseburg to Duke Albert III of Saxony.


The bishopric's fate was sealed with the Protestant Reformation, which was enforced here during the episcopate of Prince Adolph II of Anhalt, who was driven out of office by his uprising subjects during the German Peasants' War in 1525. In 1544 Elector Augustus of Saxony finally assumed the rule as Protestant administrator, with Prince George III of Anhalt as Coadjutor bishop. In 1561 the Saxon elector installed his minor son Alexander as administrator, who nevertheless died four years later, whereafter the Bishopric of Merseburg was finally incorporated by the Saxon electorate. From 1652 to 1738 the descendants of the Wettin duke Christian I held the title of a ""Duke of Saxe-Merseburg"".


At the 1815 Congress of Vienna, three-fourths of the former diocesan territory was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia, the rest remaining Saxon; the religious attitude of the people was by that time almost entirely Lutheran.",5,8 December 2006, 21 May 2021,54,0,0
17687785,3rd Cavalry Division (United Kingdom),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Cavalry_Division_(United_Kingdom),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3rd_Cavalry_Division_(United_Kingdom)&action=info,"The 3rd Cavalry Division was a division of the British Army in the First World War. It was formed at Ludgershall, Wiltshire England in September 1914 under the command of Major-General the Hon. Julian Byng. The division moved to Belgium in the first week of October 1914, landing at Ostend, although its third Brigade was only formed there once.
During the war the division took part in most of the major actions where cavalry were used as a mounted mobile force, and also many where the troops were dismounted and effectively served as infantry.


On 11 November 1918, units of the division had reached the River Dender at Leuze and Lessines in Belgium, when orders were received that they would cover the advance of the British Second Army into Germany. They started the advance on 17 November, divisional headquarters being established at Waterloo on 21 November. The following year they wintered in Belgium, and the division was officially demobilised by 31 March 1919.


The 3rd Cavalry Division began forming on 1 September 1914 at Ludgershall, Wiltshire.  Initially it commanded just two cavalry brigades â the 6th and the 7th â and divisional troops.


The 6th Cavalry Brigade was formed with the 1st Dragoons and the 10th Hussars, both from Potchefstroom, South Africa, and the 3rd Dragoon Guards from the Force in Egypt (though they did not join the brigade until 4 November in Belgium), the only regular British Army cavalry regiments not stationed in the United Kingdom or India at the outbreak of the war.[a]


The 7th Cavalry Brigade was formed with the three Household Cavalry regiments, the only regular cavalry regiments remaining in the United Kingdom after mobilization of the BEF and its transport to France.[b]  The 1st Life Guards joined from Hyde Park, the 2nd Life Guards from Regent's Park and the Royal Horse Guards from Windsor.  Each regiment only consisted of two squadrons as each had provided a squadron to the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment in 4th Cavalry Brigade in August 1914.  The detached squadrons did not rejoin their parent regiments until 11 November 1914 in Belgium.


XV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (and Brigade Ammunition Column) was formed for the division.  In peacetime, K Battery, RHA was at Christchurch and C Battery, RHA at Canterbury.  Later, G Battery, RHA (originally at Ipswich) would join in Belgium.  Strangely, two RHA brigades formed early in the war were simultaneously designated as XV Brigade, RHA.  The other was formed at Leamington, Warwickshire in January 1915 for 29th Division. The 3rd Cavalry Division's brigade was renumbered as IV Brigade, RHA in May 1915.


The 3rd Field Squadron, Royal Engineers was formed on 16 September and the 3rd Signal Squadron, Royal Engineers on 12 September, both at Ludgershall. The division was also provided with two Cavalry Field Ambulances (6th and 7th), two Mobile Veterinary Sections (13th and 14th), and a divisional supply column (four companies of the Army Service Corps).


The division departed Ludgershall on 5 October, embarked at Southampton on 6 October and landed at Ostend on 8 October (7th Brigade at Zeebrugge on 7 October) and deployed to the Western Front in France and Belgium.


The 3rd Cavalry Division served on the Western Front until the end of the war.  In 1914, the division saw action in the defence of Antwerp (9 and 10 October) and the First Battle of Ypres, notably the battles of Langemarck (21â24 October), Gheluvelt (29â31 October) and Nonne Bosschen (11 November).


To bring the division up to the standard strength of three brigades, the 8th Cavalry Brigade was formed in Belgium on 20 November 1914 with the 10th Hussars from 6th Cavalry Brigade and the Royal Horse Guards from 7th Cavalry Brigade. Each brigade was made up to three-regiment strength with yeomanry regiments: 6th Cavalry Brigade with the 1/1st North Somerset Yeomanry from 1st South Western Mounted Brigade, 7th Cavalry Brigade with the 1/1st Leicestershire Yeomanry from North Midland Mounted Brigade, and 8th Cavalry Brigade with the 1/1st Essex Yeomanry from Eastern Mounted Brigade. With the addition of its third brigade, 3rd Cavalry Division also obtained a third Cavalry Field Ambulance (8th, from England on 23 December) and a third Mobile Veterinary Section (20th, from England on 9 March 1915).


In 1915, the division took part in the Second Battle of Ypres (Battle of Frezenberg Ridge, 11â13 May) and the Battle of Loos (26â28 September).[citation needed]


On 29 February 1916, Machine Gun Squadrons were added to the cavalry brigades, formed from the machine gun sections of each brigade's constituent regiments.


1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 the division saw action in the Battle of Arras (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9â12 April). At other times, the brigades formed dismounted units and served in the trenches as regiments under the command of their brigadiers.


In March 1918, the 4th (formerly 1st Indian) and 5th (formerly 2nd Indian) Cavalry Divisions were broken up in France.  The Indian elements were sent to Egypt where they formed part of the new 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions which played a major part in the successful conclusion of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.  The British and Canadian units remained in France and most of them were transferred to the 3rd Cavalry Division causing it to be extensively reorganized.


The Household Cavalry regiments were concentrated in the 7th Cavalry Brigade and the yeomanry regiments in the 8th Cavalry Brigade.  The latter left the division on 14 March 1918, the day after the Canadian Cavalry Brigade joined from 5th Cavalry Division. The three Household Cavalry regiments left 7th Cavalry Brigade on 10 March.  They were dismounted and converted to machine gunners as No. 1 (1st Life Guards), No. 2 (2nd Life Guards) and No. 3 (Royal Horse Guards) Battalions of the Guards Machine Gun Regiment at Ãtaples. They were replaced in the brigade on the same day by the 7th Dragoon Guards from 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade of the 5th Cavalry Division, the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons from 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division and the 17th Lancers from 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade also of the 4th Cavalry Division. On 11 March, all three regiments came on the British War Establishment i.e. changed from a 4-squadron to a 3-squadron organisation.


1918 saw the return of the war of movement and the division took part in the First Battle of the Somme notably the Battle of St Quentin (21â23 March), Actions of the Somme Crossings (24 and 25 March) and Battle of the Avre (4 and 5 April); the Battle of Amiens and the battles of the Hindenburg Line (Battle of Cambrai, 8 and 9 October and the Pursuit to the Selle, 9â12 October).  Its final action was in the Advance in Flanders (9â11 November).


At the Armistice, units of the division had reached the River Dender at Leuze and Lessines in Belgium, when orders were received that they would cover the advance of the Second Army into Germany. They started the advance on 17 November, divisional headquarters being established at Waterloo on 21 November. Transport difficulties meant that the only one cavalry division could advance with Second Army so the following winter was spent in Belgium.  By 31 March 1919, the division was demobilized.


6th Cavalry Brigade was formed on 19 September 1914 at Ludgershall, Wiltshire and served with the division throughout the war.


7th Cavalry Brigade was formed on 1 September 1914 at Ludgershall, Wiltshire and served with the division throughout the war.  It was extensively restructured on 10 March 1918.


8th Cavalry Brigade was formed in Belgium on 20 November 1914.  It left the division on 14 March 1918, the day after the Canadian Cavalry Brigade joined.


The Canadian Cavalry Brigade was attached to the division from 10 April to 17 June 1916 before transferring to the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division. It rejoined the division on 13 March 1918 from 5th Cavalry Division.


The division was supported by the following units:

2932493,Princes Bridge railway station,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Bridge_railway_station,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Princes_Bridge_railway_station&action=info,"Princes Bridge was a Melbourne railway station built in 1859 and was the terminus for all Epping line and Hurstbridge line trains.  The station was named after the adjacent Princes Bridge, which crosses the Yarra River. Originally Princes Bridge station was isolated from Flinders Street station, even though it was adjacent to it, sited just on the opposite side of Swanston Street. Some years later the railway tracks were extended under the street to join the two stations, and Princes Bridge slowly became amalgamated into the larger Flinders Street station. This process was completed in May 1997.


Originally known as Prince's Bridge (as was the bridge itself), the station was opened as the city terminus of the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company line to Punt Road (Richmond) in 1859. Extended to Prahran in 1859 and Windsor in 1860, it formed today's Sandringham line. A small engine shed was built east of the station in 1859 by the company. A locomotive depot later replaced it on a new site in 1888, which was demolished to make way for the Jolimont Workshops in 1917, as part of the electrification of the suburban rail network.


The Hobson's Bay, Melbourne and St Kilda and Brighton railway companies merged into the Hobson's Bay United Railway Company in mid-1865. The three systems were connected at Flinders Street station in October 1865 and Princes Bridge station was closed. It was reopened on 2 April 1879, when the Railways Department began to use it as the terminus of the newly opened Gippsland Railway. The City Morgue was located close to the station entrance on Swanston Street, until it was acquired by the railways and demolished in 1890. The direct rail connection between Princes Bridge and Clifton Hill station was not opened until October 1901. Before that, trains from the north-eastern suburbs used the indirect route of the Inner Circle line via Fitzroy to reach Spencer Street Station.


By 1910, the two stations were effectively joined together, although they retained their separate names. There were three platforms at Princes Bridge. One was an extension of Flinders Street platform 1 (""platform 1 East""), while the other two served an island platform, with the tracks being numbered 15 and 16. Track 15 was a dead end, but track 16 (the northernmost one) had a traverser between it and a parallel run around siding, which allowed steam locomotives to change ends. A footbridge provided pedestrian access to the east end of the island platform from Flinders Street, with the 'Flinders Street D' signal box located beyond it. Further north-east of the main lines to Jolimont was a locomotive siding and a coal stage, and a carriage siding was located to the south-east. By 1957, the sidings had been rationalised, with the locomotive facilities and traverser removed. The sidings now formed part of Jolimont Yard.


The original Princes Bridge station buildings were demolished to make way for the Princes Gate Towers, which later became known as the Gas & Fuel towers. The station itself was retained, with new tracks and platforms commissioned in December 1964. On 29 June 1980, Princes Bridge station was merged with Flinders Street Station as platforms 14, 15 and 16.  By 1975, the track had been simplified to run into platform 14, 15 and 16 only, and was further simplified by 1982 due to the construction nearby of the City Circle portal of the City Loop railway.


From 6 December 1981 until 23 August 1993, a train service called ""City Circle"" originated at the station. This train ran in a circle around the City Loop, stopping at all stations, before returning to Princes Bridge. It was replaced by the City Circle tram in mid-1994.


In 1994, the Premier of the State Government Jeff Kennett announced that the Gas and Fuel towers were to be demolished to make way for a cultural precinct to be called Federation Square. The site for the project was also to include most of the space of the former Princes Bridge station, with Epping and Hurstbridge trains redirected to platform 1/14, to run via the City Loop. Piling works and crash walls for Federation Square were completed by October 1998, with the deck above finished by mid-1999. Building works atop the deck commenced in August 1999. The space of platforms 15 and 16 of the former station is now a large basement gallery space for temporary exhibitions of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.

He won his second Helpmann Award and a Green Room Award for this performance.


The following year he played Hamlet in a sellout season at the Melbourne Theatre Company (a role he would reprise in 2013 in Sydney for Belvoir St Theatre). He played one of the lead roles in The Wild Duck (directed by Simon Stone) which had successful seasons in Sydney, Melbourne and Oslo for The Ibsen Festival.

21429270,Rob Bagg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Bagg,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rob_Bagg&action=info,"Rob Bagg (born February 3, 1985) is a retired professional Canadian football wide receiver. He played 11 seasons for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 2008 to 2018. He is a member of the 101st Grey Cup winning team and was named a West Division All-Star in 2014. Bagg played CIS football for the Queen's Gaels football team.


Bagg attended Frontenac Secondary School in Kingston, Ontario from 1999 to 2003. After running for the cross-country team in grades 9 and 10, new to the sport of football at age 16, Bagg joined the Frontenac Falcons Senior Football Team in his grade 11 year. Sporting the school's garnet and grey colours, Bagg helped the team to win not only their division finals (EOSSA), but also the Provincial finals (OFSAA) at the National Capital Bowl in the then 'Sky Dome', now the Rogers Centre in both of his senior years.


In 2003, Bagg attended Queen's University, joining the school's football team that same year. In 2005, he played in six games, recording 17 catches for 166 yards as well as returning seven punts for 157 yards and six kickoffs for 67 yards. In 2006, Bagg played in all eight games and ranked 12th in the country in receiving yards, recording 30 receptions for 565 yards and four touchdowns. He was also featured more on special teams, returning 58 punts for 412 yards and 13 kickoffs for 328 yards.


After the 2006 season concluded, Bagg went undrafted in the 2007 CFL Draft. He was high on the Saskatchewan Roughriders list, but with only two draft picks and already selecting receiver David McKoy, they did not draft him. Instead, he signed with the team shortly after the draft and attended the 2007 training camp with the Roughriders. After making the roster, he declined the position in order to return to the Gaels for a fifth season. The Roughriders would win the Grey Cup that year.


For the Golden Gaels' 2007 season, Bagg led the team in receiving, and was fifth in the country, playing in seven games with 36 catches for 804 yards and six touchdowns. That includes a 341-yard receiving game against the Toronto Varsity Blues where he also caught three touchdown passes. This single game performance is the second most receiving yards in a game in CIS history, behind former Queen's receiver James MacLean. Being the team's top receiver, he saw less time on special teams, returning 13 punts for 192 yards and six kickoffs for 130 yards.


On January 23, 2008, Bagg signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, the team that had expressed interest in him before the 2007 season. After again making the active roster out of training camp, Bagg dressed as a receiver for 16 games in 2008. After a plethora of injuries at the receiver position, Bagg was pressed into service during the Banjo Bowl versus the Winnipeg Blue Bombers where he recorded his first CFL reception and finished the game with six catches for 52 yards in the Roughriders' comeback win. He had an explosive game against Montreal where he had six catches for 146 yards, including a 72-yard reception, and was named the CFLâs Canadian Player of the Week. He finished the regular season with 22 catches for 371 yards. His debut season was peculiarly marked by his bad luck near the end zone. Bagg was stopped at the three-, two-, and one-yard lines after making catches, stopping just short of his first CFL touchdowns. He also had two catches for 18 yards in the Roughriders' West Semi-Final loss to the BC Lions.


With the Roughriders electing not to re-sign Corey Grant for the 2009 season, Bagg took over the wideside wide receiver spot he vacated. Bagg had a decent start to the season until he had a 120-yard receiving game against the BC Lions where he caught his first and second career CFL touchdowns, after meeting futility in 2008. After an injury to Weston Dressler in week 15, Bagg started at slotback the next week and shortside wide receiver the two weeks following, before finishing the season at his familiar wideside spot. Showcasing his versatility, he had another 100-yard receiving game against BC while at the shortside receiver position with a season-high 124 yards and a touchdown. Finishing the season with 59 catches for 807 yards and five touchdowns, Bagg was named the Roughriders' nominee for Most Outstanding Canadian after his breakout year. Additionally, Bagg led the offense with six defensive tackles and had two special teams tackles and a forced fumble. In the West Final game, Bagg had three catches for 73 yards and a touchdown, while in the loss to Montreal in the 2009 Grey Cup, he recorded three receptions for 27 yards and one carry for 13 yards. In the 2010 season, in a game against the Calgary Stampeders Bagg had a season-ending injury, which also kept him out of all of the 2011 season. Just as it appeared as though Bagg was going to return to the Riders for the 2011 CFL season he re-injured his left ACL in off-season training, which caused him to miss the entire 2011 season. After recovering from injuring his left knee twice Bagg worked his way back into the lineup for the 2012 CFL season.

The film is based on the 1889 British novel Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome. It was shot at the RosenhÃ¼gel Studios in Vienna and on location in Amsterdam and along the River Rhine through the Rhineland region and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg of Germany and Switzerland. The film's sets were designed by the veteran art director Willi Herrmann.


The advertisement salesmen Harry Berg und Jerome, named ""Jo"", Sommer are on holiday at the Bodensee alone. Jo is trying to catch the young girl Grit and Harry wants to get rid of his intrusive girlfriend Julitschka. When she suddenly appears, Harry and Jo are trying to buy a boat to drive away. They also find a dog and call him ""Sputnik"".


Also the art salesman Georg Nolte is trying to have holiday but his wife Carlotta and his daughter Grit are not allowing him it. In a bar he's listening to Harry's and Jo's talk about the boat and asks them to join them, he offers himself as a cook. Both agree and the three of them are calling the trip ""Three Men on a boat, not to forget about the dog"", in reference to a well-known book. They also call the boat ""Marianne"".


When the wives discover the missing of their husbands they are trying to follow them. Julitschka even is hiring a Swiss detective Georg offers to travel over the Rhine, so he can be at an auction in Amsterdam to buy a painting by Renoire and sell one by Brueghel. On the boat Georg and Harry are named Captains (Georg claimed that he was on a battleship, however he told later that he was only a visitor) and Jo the first maid. But things change after they have an accident at the Rheinfall, where Georg doesn't noticed it, so he becomes the first maid instead of Jo. Later they have another accident with another ship, where one of the crew, the maid Betje is falling over board and is saved by the three men from the ""Marianne"".


During the travel they also stop in KÃ¶nigswinter, where Georg finds his daughter and he realized that Jo was after her, but he allows him. He hasn't seen his wife and tells her over the phone to wait in Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Harry is trying to catch his luck with Betje.


In Amsterdam Harry and Jo go to the auction but Georg is late, because he's stopping the boat at a place for carriage boats. When he comes to the auction he's told that the Renoire is sold very cheap to a young guy. Apparently Jo accidentally bought the paining, because he didn't knew the hand-raise-rule of the auction. Harry told Georg about it in the way, that Jo did a great bluff. Georg is impressed with Jo and at the end everybody is happy.


At the end Julitschka doesn't want Harry any more and starts dating the detective. Meanwhile, Harry and Georg are on the boat with Betje and Carlotta, while the boat is tied by a rope to a car with Jo and Grit inside. At the end Jo said, ""Would be good to get rid of them"", not noticing that the rope got ripped. The movie ends with that scene.


The location is changed from the Thames to the Rhine River, the story differs substantially and is set to happen in 1960. The main connection to the novel is the basic idea of three friends travelling downriver in a boat and the names are of the characters are similar. The novel itself is also mentioned in a dialog.

In some countries it was released as the third single off the album, following ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" and ""Ain't Love a Bitch"". It only reached the Top 70 in the UK, topping out at  #63 but reached #23 in Ireland. The song was covered by Vince Neil on the Japanese version of his album Exposed.


Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the song as being a ""winning track"" in the same mold as ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" and ""Ain't Love a Bitch"". Circus writer David Fricke suggested that the ""stocky, swaggering sound"" that Stewart's band achieves on the song ""proves Stewart has not forgotten how to rock.""  Henry McNulty of the Hartford Courant considered it to be ""the most worthwhile song"" on the album, describing it as a ""straightforward rocker"" on which Stewart seems to be having fun.  McNulty particularly praise the way the ""rich, warm horns"" set off the screeching lead guitar and tinkling piano.  The Beaver County Times described the song as ""a rollicking Chuck Berry-style rocker, complete with honky-tonk piano."" CD Review described the song as a ""barrelhouse rocker."" The Albany Herald wrote that the ""hardrocking"" song is one of the highlights among the songs of ""up and down love affairs"" on the Blondes Have More Fun album. Rolling Stone critic Janet Maslin described it as one of the three ""tolerable"" songs on the album.  The Ottawa Journal similarly called it the best song on the album.  Author Sharon Davis described the song as Stewart's last hit before 1983's ""Baby Jane.""  Critic Dave Tianen rated the song as Stewarts 4th worst (two notches better than 2nd place ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy,"") saying that it ""would almost be beneath RuPaul.""  But critic Mark Brown considered it to be ""wonderful.""


""Blondes (Have More Fun)"" was included on Rod Stewart's live video Live at the L.A. Forum.  A live version was also included on the 2014 album Live 1976-1998: Tonight's the Night.  Graham Hicks of the Edmonton Journal felt the live version was preferable to the studio version, calling the live version a ""rhythm and blues number"" and stating that this proved that the ""production"" was responsible for the blandness of the studio version.


The music video for the song was on MTV's first day.[citation needed]",3,23 August 2011, 29 December 2020,77,0,0

33019038,James B. Simpson,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Simpson,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_B._Simpson&action=info,"James B. Simpson (1927-2002) was a journalist, author and Episcopal priest, best known for writing several volumes of Simpsonâs Contemporary Quotations, a set of books of quotations. His work continues to be a trusted and recognized favorite among journalists, scholars, academics and quote enthusiasts.


Born the youngest son of an undertaker, Simpson was a native of Fort Smith, Arkansas. Simpson would joke that his love for quotes was perhaps genetic since his motherâwho died when he was just an infantâwould also highlight her favorite passages and clip articles from newspapers and magazines just like the hobby that her son developed.


His childhood hometown was also where he first began his journalism career. Once finished with high school, he wrote for the local newspaper, the Southwest American.


Subsequently, Simpson attended the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University near Chicago where he continued his study the subject. During this time, his love for quotes began to blossom. Simpson took a sociology course which provided the inspirational backdrop to collecting contemporary quotations as he has likened the art of archiving quotes to âa sociology project.â When he was a senior in college, he even asked his parents for Bartlett's Familiar Quotations for Christmas one year.


Upon graduation from Northwestern in 1949, Simpson embarked on a career in journalism by writing for the Associated Press and United Press International. He spent his summers working in newsrooms in cities across the country such as Chicago and San Francisco before ultimately settling in New York. Besides his domestic travels, he also reported internationally from London, Lagos, Moscow, Tokyo, and Beijing.


In addition, Simpson had written for periodicals including Esquire, Town & Country, TV Guide, Readerâs Digest, and the New York Times Magazine. Later in life as a priest, he was also a correspondent for the British publications, The Living Church and Church Times, and authored several books on religion including Veil and Cowl: Writings from the World of Monks and Nuns, Regent of the Sea, The Long Shadows of Lambeth X, Stars in His Crown: Anglican Religious Orders, Discerning God's Will: Lambeth XI, Seasons of the Spirit, and A Treasury of Anglican Art.


Apart from his career as a journalist, Simpson was also a television network consultant, worked in the advertising world as an account executive and then had a stint in corporate public relations.


His interest in quotes stemmed from his journalistic experience and an introduction to early television. During the 15 years he spent in New York, one of his first jobs involved searching for the funny or unique sayings of upcoming guest stars on the early NBC talk show, ""Who Said That?"" His job was to clip quotations from the dayâs paper for use on the program. It began when in 1951, Zsa Zsa Gabor, a star of the show, asked Simpsonâwho was working as a young radio journalist in New York City at the timeâto collect some quotes that would be useful for that dayâs program. Subsequently, other stars began utilizing Simpson as well. Finally, after learning of his assistance, the showâs producers asked him to take the lead on writing the show.


By the time the show was cancelled, Simpson had already compiled enough quotes to publish the first version of his quote compendiums in 1957 under the title Best Quotes of â54, â55, â56.


Following the publication of Best Quotes, Simpson wrote a series of pieces on modern spiritual leaders for Look magazine. This project was followed by a biography he authored in 1962 on Michael Ramsey, the 100th Archbishop of Canterbury, which was listed among the 200 best books of that year. Through writing the book, Simpsonâwho had wanted to attend the seminary ever since college but ultimately resolved to move to New Yorkâfelt a higher calling and finally left his career as a journalist at 38 to enroll in the Nashotah House seminary to become an Episcopal priest.  Nashotah House offers a rigorous core curriculum, including Hebrew and Greek, combined with an emphasis on the life of prayer and a demanding community life.  


As the late librarian of Congress Daniel J. Boorstin put it, the experiences of his early life âfinally inspired him to still another view of the immortal word, and he became an Episcopal priest.â It was the second edition of his Contemporary Quotations anthology which provided him with the funds to enter the seminary in 1964.


After graduating and becoming ordained in 1967, he served as curate for Christ's Church in Rye, New York and as rector for Christ Church in Middletown, New Jersey and became an editor for The Anglican Digest and the director of the Episcopal Book Club.


Despite his duties and commitment to the priesthood, he retained a strong appreciation for journalism. A voracious reader, he turned his analytical eye to the words of others, always looking out for an interesting, meaningful, or unique phrase.


In his search for quotes, he would read eight daily newspapers, seven weekly magazines, and a dozen monthlies. In any given day, he would usually find about eight or ten quotes of interest that he would choose to save.


On choosing the most notable quotations, he would highlight his favorite sayings and then let them sit for a week or two before taking another look. Upon a second examination, if he still felt they were worthy of posterity, he would then catalog the story from which the quote was taken by clipping the article from the publication and storing it in a binder as well as noting its source, date and context in his computer.


In addition, he thoroughly scrutinized every quote even more before adding it to the published editions of his books. Specifically, Simpson wanted to avoid the inclusion of a quote that would lose its significance in the future, so he was fond of saying that he would let quotes âmarinate in timeâ for six months to a year to judge their lasting quality, saying that, âThereâs a certain news judgment involved to know a good quote. You have to ask if it is said originally and whether it will still be valued in 10 to 15 years. I wonât put any quote in immediately. I have to wait to see if it holds up to the test of time.â


He took his quotes, according to a 1997 article in The Christian Science Monitor, from not only newspapers but weekly and monthly magazines and the transcripts of 60 Minutes, 20/20, Dateline NBC, Primetime, and Sunday morning talk show broadcasts. In fact, at home he would even place a tape recorder near his television so that he was always at the ready to capture notable words.


Simpson later moved to Washington, D.C. in 1988 in order to facilitate his quotation collecting and research. Nevertheless, he still remained equally committed to his priestly duties by heading the congregation at the Church of Ascension and Saint Agnes as well as serving the parishes of All Souls Church and St. Paulâs Episcopal Church on K Street and providing ecumenical services as a chaplain for The Georgetown, a retirement residence. In fact, Simpson felt that his work as a priest and his penchant for collecting quotations were symbiotically intertwined in saying that, âIt helps make my sermons more interesting. It helps me be aware of trends in medicine and lifestyles. It helps me be involved in the world, so Iâm not just a priest.â


Of the most notable quotes he had compiled in his career, Simpsonâs personal favorites included one by the novelist, Graham Greene: âWhen a train pulls into a great city, I am reminded of the closing moments of an overtureâ one from the Bible, Ecclesiasticus 39: âHe that giveth his mind â¦ will keep the sayings of the renowned, and where subtle parables are, he will be there also. He will seek the secrets of grave sentences and be conversant in dark parablesâ and one by Albert Camus: âIn the depth of winter I finally learned that within me lay an invincible summer.â


For more than 40 years, the Rev. James B. Simpson saw as his mission the documentation of the words of leaders, thinkers, journalists, social activists, artists, and pundits. He fulfilled that mission with great success, becoming the author of Simpsonâs Contemporary Quotations, a book series of multiple editions which contain a collection of the best quotations of the modern era, particularly of the past fifty years.


Simpson wrote that Contemporary Quotations picks up after James Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (first published in 1855) in that seeks to capture the important quotes of our time as, or before, they become classics. He chose quotes for his book based on their uniqueness, for how they stood out within a context, and the likeliness that they would have lasting power.


One of the most important elements of his quotes, he wrote, was that they were accessible to his readers. This, he felt, was something that made Simpson's Contemporary Quotations unique. He also found the historical and societal context of quotes important.


While other authors in this genre wrote books to locate the precise form of the quotes of the ancients and the literary classics, Simpson, with his journalistâs sensibility, had another plan. His idea was to tell use quotations to tell what contemporaries were saying as they said it. He wanted to portray their words in the pure, stark readable language of the day so that readers could properly assess, not only the words, but perhaps the character behind them.


At a time when words are often lost amid modern-day images and spin, Simpson sought to help make sense of the world by creating Contemporary Quotations as a means of holding them safely in time for closer examination.


Simpsonâs Contemporary Quotations is a series of books compiled and edited by Simpson beginning in 1957, followed up by subsequent publications in 1964 and 1988 and finally with the last edition being published by HarperCollins in 1997. The following titles are among the various editions in the series, including: Best Quotes, Simpsonâs Contemporary Quotations: The Most Notable Quotes, 1950-1988 and Simpsonâs Contemporary Quotations: The Most Notable Quotes From 1950 to the Present.


Simpson had many friends in the literary, journalistic, and religious worlds, and he got fan mail from around the world for his books of quotations.


He was listed in ""Who's Who in America"" in the 1990s.


Aside from his collection of over 200 books on quotations, Simpson had a passion for other items. He was an avid collector of old-fashioned ""mustache cups"", miniature busts of famous individuals who he felt were the best speakers of the time and was a self-proclaimed âamateur collectorâ of Biedermeier furnitureâa form of German furniture for the âcommon man.â While living in Washington, Fr. Simpson also became a member of the Cosmos Club.


Near the end of Simpsonâs life, he offered his will and estate, to his alma mater, Northwestern University, which turned it down. Subsequently, he made the same offer to American University located in Washington, D.C. in 1997. As a resident of Cathedral Heights, he noted that choosing American for the gift seemed natural since the university was located in his neighborhood and he had always felt welcome in its academic community through his interactions with faculty members, visits to the library, and guest lectures on the importance of quotes in journalism.


The bequest included $350,000 to fund the continuation of his mission for quotation collection as well as the valuable copyright to Father Simpsonâs personal collection of quotes-more than 22,000 from the second half of the 20th century-and a collection of busts of famous quote-makers.

Incorporated in 1928 and operational by 1930, DOSCO was predated by the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO), which was a merger of the Dominion Coal Company, the Dominion Iron and Steel Company and the Nova Scotia Steel Company.  DOSCO was one of the largest private employers in Canada during the 1930s-1950s.  In 1957, DOSCO was purchased as a subsidiary of A.V. Roe Canada Ltd.. 


In 1966 it terminated coal operations. This led in 1967 to the creation of a crown corporation, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, which took over operations.


Industrial Cape Breton consisted of two distinctive geographic regions for industrial activity: the ""north side"" of Sydney Harbour, and the ""south side"".  The north side was dominated in the 1800s by the General Mining Association (GMA), which had been formed in the 1820s after the Colony of Cape Breton Island was amalgamated back into Nova Scotia. Several independent collieries opened on the south side and by the 1870s, Canada's federal government had implemented its National Policy of economic protectionist measures. It was during this decade that the leading operators on the ""south side"" foresaw the benefits of amalgamating and modernizing to replace lost American coal markets in eastern Canada with Cape Breton coal.


In 1889, Henry Melville Whitney and Frederick Stark Pearson of Boston, Massachusetts, formed the Whitney coal syndicate with Benjamin Franklin Pearson of the People's Heat and Light Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The group purchased one mine and obtained options on others south of Sydney on eastern Cape Breton Island. Premier William Stevens Fielding and the Liberal provincial administration favored Whitney's entry into the coal business because his steamships and street-railway electric generators consumed large quantities of coal. The Whitney syndicate was offered an unprecedented 99-year lease on a fixed royalty; the group exercised its options, acquiring most of the existing bituminous coal mines in eastern Cape Breton and co-opting such local figures as John Stewart McLennan and David MacKeen. This process took some months, and Whitney was not ready to consolidate operations at Sydney until early 1893.


On February 1, 1893, Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO) was incorporated with Whitney as president, B.F. Whitney as secretary and F.S. Pearson as chief engineer. Early investors in the enterprise included Whitney's younger brother, William Collins Whitney; his brothers-in-law, Henry F. Dimock and Charles T. Barney; and Almeric H. Paget, who later married William's daughter Pauline.


The new company included the following properties:


DOMCO also inherited a mixed variety of railway lines linking the various mines.  These were consolidated and operated as a department of the company, and in 1895 were extended south to Louisbourg. The railroad lines were incorporated in 1910 as the Sydney and Louisburg Railway.


By 1912, DOMCO operated 16 collieries, comprising 40% of Canada's coal production. The company effected numerous efficiencies and improvements. There were, however, costly mistakes, prominent among them the tendency to become locked into low-price contracts (such as to Whitney's companies), thus missing a large market at higher prices. By 1901 some 90 percent of its output was committed to such low-price contracts. The company made a large public offering of stock, which tumbled in price when Whitney failed to get the American import duty on coal removed or at least reduced.


Flushed with the success of creating DOMCO in the 1890s, the Whitney syndicate sought to create a use for ""slack coal"" resulting from mixing and screening processes at DOMCO's coal wash plants.  Whitney expanded operations at Sydney with the organization in March 1899 of the Dominion Iron & Steel Company Ltd. (DISCO), which had funding in both Canada and the United States. Whitney was joined in the new enterprise by his long-time business friends F.S. Pearson, B.F. Pearson, W.C. Whitney, C.T. Barney, H.F. Dimock, A.H. Paget and J.S. McLennan. The promise of federal bounties, together with concessions from the Liberal provincial administration of Premier George Henry Murray, enabled DISCO to begin work in June 1899 on the largest integrated steel mill in the British Empire. Located on the south side of Sydney Harbour, which Whitney said offered more advantages to steel making than anywhere else in the world, the mill was completed in 1901.


DISCO operated coke ovens which cooked this slack coal to create coke to fuel its oxygen blast furnaces that were used to smelt iron ore mined by DISCO at its mine on Bell Island in Newfoundland and shipped to Sydney.


Competitors in Britain, France, Germany and the United States were initially concerned. However, continuing problems of management and cost control led to Whitney's early withdrawal from the project. Later in 1901, Whitney and his associates sold majority control of DOMCO to engineer turned businessman James Ross of Montreal, and their minority share of DISCO to Ross and other Canadian interests. Whitney resigned as president of DISCO in 1902 and as a member of the DOMCO board in December 1909; he remained a member of the DISCO board until 1909.


The year 1901 also saw further changes in the coal and steel industry on Cape Breton Island when the rival GMA, operator of coal mines on the ""north side"" of Sydney Harbour, as well as a newly inaugurated steel mill at that location, sold its properties to Nova Scotia Steel Company Ltd. (SCOTIA) of New Glasgow.


In 1903, Ross and the Canadian investors in DISCO sold control to James H. Plummer of Toronto, Ontario. By 1910, Plummer gained control of DOMCO from Ross and made both DOMCO and DISCO subsidiary companies of a new entity called Dominion Steel Corporation, which also counted mainland Nova Scotia's Cumberland Railway and Coal Company as a subsidiary.

General managers


Further consolidation of industrial activity on Cape Breton Island saw SCOTIA taken over in 1917 by American investors as its steel mill had closed in 1914, and the company focused on coal mining in Sydney Mines and manufactured steel products at its extensive facilities in Trenton, Pictou County.


The fall-out from World War I saw a syndicate of British investors led by Montreal, Quebec industrialist Roy M. Wolvin negotiate a takeover of Dominion Steel Corporation from Plummer in 1919.  BESCO proposed a $500 million merger of DOMCO and DISCO, along with various British steel and shipbuilding interests.  In 1921, SCOTIA was merged with the conglomerate to form the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO).


The scope and scale of BESCO was truly mind-boggling.  In addition to its coal mines and steel mills operating as a complete monopoly across the entire Sydney Coal Field, BESCO also operated coal mines, steel mills and foundries in the Pictou Coal Field in Trenton, New Glasgow, Stellarton and Westville, as well as North America's deepest coal mines in Springhill, Nova Scotia, and iron mines in Bell Island, Newfoundland.  It also operated several industrial railways and various shipping ports throughout the province.


However, the mergers that resulted in the formation of BESCO also amalgamated an inordinate amount of debt.  During its 8-year history, BESCO was in a constant financial crisis and by 1925 required an annual operating profit of $8 million ($100 million when adjusted for inflation in 2010) to meet these financial commitments.  As a result, BESCO's investors pressured management to force many difficult working conditions in order to achieve higher production from its workforce.  This resulted in unprecedented labour unrest and militancy which would forever transform Industrial Cape Breton (see Davis Day).


Profits fell and coal and steel markets were declining throughout the 1920s as North America's industrial and consumer practices changed.  BESCO management tried to desperately save the company,  however bitter strikes by workers, culminating in widespread social and civil unrest in 1925, saw BESCO slip further into debt.


BESCO subsidiary DISCO (the steel mill) fell into receivership in the spring of 1926 after short-term financing was refused; this would eventually lead to the break-up of the conglomerate.  DISCO was liquidated in 1927 but the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refused to dissolve BESCO.  Wolvin resigned as president and sold his holdings after his reorganization plan was rejected by other shareholders and he was succeeded by C.B. McNaught.


In 1928 a new holding company called Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (also DOSCO) was formed as a holding company by McNaught and various BESCO investors.  In May 1930 BESCO was dissolved and the new company took over its industrial properties.  DOSCO implemented management processes that put a halt to the financial troubles through the 1930s.  The company's fortunes were boosted by World War II with its control of manufacturing and their inputs and at one point DOSCO was the largest private employer in the nation.


Following the war, DOSCO's industrial prominence continued to slide as alternative fuels and sources for steel took force, combining with declines in government subsidization of both industries.  In 1957, A.V. Roe Canada acquired a controlling interest in DOSCO in a bid to diversify its operations beyond the aircraft manufacturing and defence industries.  In 1958, DOSCO subsidiary Cumberland Railway and Coal Company closed its mines in Springhill; the mines being closed following the Springhill Mining Disaster.  The associated railway service limped on until permission to abandon was granted in 1961, and the last train ran in 1962. The Cumberland Railway continued to exist as a corporation, however, as the S&L was made its subsidiary in 1961, doing business as the Sydney & Louisburg Division of the Cumberland Railway. This was done primarily to make the provincially chartered S&L eligible for federal railway subsidies.


In 1962 A.V. Roe Canada was dissolved and its assets merged into the newly formed conglomerate Hawker Siddeley Canada, which sought to rid itself of money-losing operations.


By the early 1960s DOSCO was in a continuous slide and sought to halt its decline by shutting various poorly performing mines in the Pictou and Sydney coal fields; from 9 in 1960 to 5 in 1965.  Despite shedding other money-losing subsidiaries it was still losing money and under pressure from Hawker Siddeley Canada to reduce red ink.  In 1965, DOSCO announced that its remaining mines had only 15 years of production left and it would not undertake any further capital expenditures and would exit the industry within months.


The vast public outcry to DOSCO's announcement in Industrial Cape Breton saw the minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson come under incredible political pressure to resolve the crisis.  Pearson announced the formation of the Donald Commission of inquiry into the industry, which would eventually lead to the formation of the federal Crown corporation Cape Breton Development Corporation (or DEVCO) and the provincial Crown corporation Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO) which expropriated DOSCO's mines and steel mill in 1968.",13,14 July 2006, 6 August 2021,137,0,0

They are known as an inter-broker dealer.  The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by CME Group in November 2018.


The company developed from a merger between Garban plc and Intercapital plc which created Garban-Intercapital plc in 1999. Intercapital plc was founded by Michael Spencer in 1986 as Intercapital Private Group Limited ('IPGL'); in 1998 it was acquired by Exco plc in a reverse takeover and the enlarged business was renamed Intercapital plc. Garban plc was established in the 1970s as the financial services division of MAI plc. Several takeovers followed, starting in 1977 when MAI plc acquired Harlow, Meyer and Co. Mallon & Dorney and Garvin GuyButler were acquired by 1982 and in 1983, Garban LLC was acquired giving MAI plc significant broking interests in the UK and overseas. In 1996, MAI plc was merged into United News & Media plc: its financial services division was then de-merged and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1998 as Garban plc.


The company changed its name from Garban-Intercapital plc to ICAP plc in 2001. In 2006 it bought EBS, a major trading platform for foreign exchange. On 5 December 2007, ICAP acquired Traiana, Inc. for $247 million (Â£121 million). Traiana is a provider of post-trade processing, client servicing, and trading software for financial institutions.


In June 2012 ICAP acquired Plus Stock Exchange plc and relaunched it as the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange (ISDX), one of only six Regulated Investment Exchanges (RIE) in the United Kingdom, the others being the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE), the London Metal Exchange (LME), the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and BATS Chi-X Europe. In September 2013, ICAP settled allegations that they had manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  The United States Department of Justice charged three former employees, and ICAP paid $65 million to the U.S.'s Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Â£14 million ($22 million) to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.


In October 2014, ICAP's in-house legal team was awarded the Legal 500 2014 UK In-House Team Winner in the Litigation category. In November 2015, ICAP agreed terms for the disposal of its global hybrid voice broking and information business to Tullett Prebon. The company changed its name from ICAP plc to NEX Group plc in December 2016.

A small species, their wingspan range recorded is between 4.7 and 7.0Â mm. Very similar to Platycheirus and other Melanostoma species, but with close inspection of some finer details, it can be identified with certainty. Adult males closely resemble Platycheirus clypeatus, but lack the flattening or broadening of the front legs characteristic of most Platycheirus males. Females resemble female Melanostoma scalare, sharing similar triangular tergite markings, but have a shiny, black frons, which separates them from M. scalare and most Platycheirus species. Also, M. mellinum may prove to be a species complex.


Their preferred habitat include grasslands and moorlands, including those in hilly and mountainous regions. Adults can be found feeding on the pollen of grasses (Poaceae) and other wind-pollinated plants.


Little is known of their biology, but the larvae are suspected to be a general predator of small insects in leaf litter.


Flight times in Britain and Ireland are from April to October with peaks in late May - early June and from July to August.

Restitution would have been sought using databases containing the data submitted by Holocaust victims and their heirs and information about the property that was taken from them. Those who were interested in participating were directed to fill out a questionnaire to determine their eligibility and may also have accessed a website and call center for assistance. Questionnaires had been collected and processed by an administrator and then forwarded to the Israeli Government, which had planned to negotiate with the relevant Governments, companies and others who hold Holocaust assets. This project used innovations, such as the Internet, not used in previous restitution attempts and marked the most serious attempt at obtaining restitution for aged Holocaust victims and their heirs. As of April 2014 the project lost 95% of its funding, is accepting no requests, and has been absorbed into the Israeli Ministry of Senior Citizens.


Project HEART was an undertaking of the Government of Israel in cooperation with the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI). It was chaired by Rafi Eitan, former senior citizens affairs minister, and its executive director was Bobby Brown of JAFI. Brown has been involved in Holocaust restitution for more than ten years, including when he served as Diaspora affairs advisor during Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's first term.


The project began in late February 2011. It was being funded by the Israeli government, which provided it with more than $2.5 million a year for three years. This was the first time the government of Israel had sponsored a Holocaust restitution project.


Its purpose was to locate Jewish Holocaust victims and their heirs whose personal property was seized by the Nazis and provide them with the means and information to help them seek restitution for the stolen property. Efforts to reach people worldwide included advertising, media exposure, and encouraging Jewish nongovernmental organizations to spread the word to their members and to the Jewish community in general. The program's focus was to gather information with the ultimate goal of restitution. Its first step was to identify people with potential claims for certain types of private property that was confiscated, looted, or forcibly sold in countries governed or occupied by Nazi or Axis forces during the Holocaust. The various types of property that are eligible for restitution include immovable property such as real estate; movable property such as jewelry, tools, or art; or intangible personal property such as stocks, bonds, or savings accounts. However, if Holocaust victims or their heirs had already received restitution for a particular piece of property, then they were no longer eligible for participation in Project HEART.


A searchable database, ostensibly assembled from European public records, of more than two million pieces of property that belonged to Jews before the beginning of World War II was released on May 1, 2011, made it the one of the largest publicly available databases of Jewish property lost during the Holocaust era. It was created to help Holocaust victims and their heirs identify property that may belong to them and includes property addresses, lists of homeowners and professions, lists of known confiscated properties, business directories, insurance policies, and other information. This database and one that contains information collected regarding Holocaust victims and their heirs along with their potential claims would have then been used to seek restitution along with the cooperation of governments and others that have not done so yet. The property database would have been be particularly useful for corroborating and authenticating property claims.


Participation in Project HEART required filling out a questionnaire, which had been found on the project's website. Providing evidence of property ownership was not required to be eligible. Individuals noted on the questionnaire why they think they owned or are beneficiaries of eligible property. A website and a call center were available in 13 languages, and either one could have been utilized to obtain questionnaires or more information about the program. Individuals may also have accessed the property database on the website for research purposes. Once all questionnaires were processed, restitution information was to be classified as containing complete, incomplete, or no documentation. After that, the information would have been submitted to the government of Israel, which would then begin negotiations for restitution with the governments of countries in which the properties were lost and other relevant bodies. Project HEART insisted that any compensation recovered would have been disbursed directly to Holocaust survivors and their heirs if they can be located.


One of the commitments that formed the basis for this endeavor to seek restitution was the Terezin Declaration passed during the 2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague. In this resolution, 46 countries agreed to the principle of compensating Holocaust victims and their heirs for property lost in their respective countries and that restitution should be handled by the governments involved. However, this resolution is morally rather than legally binding.


Previous attempts at restitution include legislation that was passed in Eastern European countries around the time of the fall of Communism that allowed Jews to seek restitution for property lost during the Holocaust, but the resulting compensation was not inclusive of all victims and all properties. There are also organizations that have been devoted to securing restitution for Holocaust survivors and to assisting Holocaust victims in various ways. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany Claims Conference, founded in 1951, is one of the best-known institutions that has fought for this cause. And in 1993, the World Jewish Restitution Organization was founded by several Jewish groups including JAFI and the Claims Conference to work with countries and governments and Jewish communities and organizations on negotiations and cooperative agreements and to research and compile information about Jewish communal and public property.

11567292,Symphony No. 10 (Schubert),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._10_(Schubert),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symphony_No._10_(Schubert)&action=info,"Schubert's Symphony No. 10 in D major, D 936A, is an unfinished work that survives in a piano sketch. Written during the last weeks of the composer's short life, it was only properly identified in the 1970s. It has been orchestrated by Brian Newbould in a completion that has subsequently been performed, published and recorded.


The sketch appears to date from the last weeks of the composer's life, in OctoberâNovember 1828, and is presumed to be the Last Symphony (Letzte Symphonie) mentioned by his friend Eduard von Bauernfeld in an appreciation of Schubert published in the Wiener Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Kunst, Literatur, Theater und Mode for 13 June 1829.


The music of the symphony appears to some extent exploratory and contains unusual elements, notably the hybrid form of the third movement and the highly contrapuntal nature of much of the material. Sketches for the third movement are intermingled with several counterpoint exercises, which suggests that it is related in some way to the single counterpoint lesson Schubert took from Simon Sechter a few weeks before his death in 1828.


The sketches are written on two staves, with voice leading, and harmonies ranging from complete to partly indicated. The manuscript contains about 30 instrumental indications, confirming that the intended orchestra was similar in size to the eighth and ninth symphonies, with a trio of trombones.


The manuscript contains sketches of three movements, each one in different time signatures. Scholars agree that the second movement is virtually completed, while the two outer movements are in less completed form. According to composer, conductor and Schubert expert Brian Newbould, the second and third movements are complete in the sketches, with the first only lacking the recapitulation.


Allegro maestoso in D major, 44


For the first movement, in sonata form, Schubert wrote the full exposition; however, he then crossed out the first theme group and the transition and rewrote them on the following page; these lead to the second theme as written in the first draft. After ending the exposition in several A major cadences, the tempo changes from Allegro maestoso to Andante, and the new key of Bâ­ minor is established. This new section, acting as an unconventional development, presents a solemn chorale-like variation of the second subject played by the trombones. According to Newbould, the whole development is written out, but there is no recapitulation. Actually, many sketches of Schubert's finished works lack the recapitulation (like his last piano sonatas), due to it being mostly a partially transposed repetition of the exposition. After this, a series of short ""modules"" marked Presto serve as sketches for the coda of the movement.


Andante in B minor, 38


The second movement, whose lyricism is reminiscent of the composer's Winterreise, as well as foreshadowing Mahler's Kindertotenlieder, is also laid out in sonata form. In the sketch, Schubert crossed out the coda, despite no apparent falling-off in quality. Also, a haunting (in Newbould's words) Fâ¯ major melody at the end of the second subject group of the exposition does not reappear later in the movement (it had been added as an afterthought in another page, apparently after discarding the coda).


Newbould claims that the Fâ¯ major melody was ""too beautiful"" to be heard only once, and that Schubert's intention was to repeat it in the recapitulation (in the tonic major, B major) before the coda (as expected in sonata form), but that he left those details aside and he began the third movement instead.


Scherzo (Allegro moderato in Newbould's edition) in D major, 24


The third movement was at first labelled ""scherzo"", despite being in 24. After a writing a few measures, Schubert left it aside, instead filling the page with counterpoint exercises testing the compatibility of the elements, in order to give the original opening a logical continuation. On another page, the movement is started again, this time materializing into a complete movement that became the finale of the symphony (according to Newbould). The movement is unconventional, either as a scherzo or as a finale. What was intended as the trio of a scherzo in ternary form in the first draft, became an episode later, while the piece was reshaped into a rondo. The movement is riddled with counterpoint (canons, invertible counterpoint, fugato, augmentation), and the two main themes (the original ""scherzo"" and ""trio"" themes) are superimposed at the end of the symphony. According to Newbould, several middle-sized sections of the movement have to be reshuffled in order to understand the movement, and that two of them were discarded (despite not explicitly deleted in the manuscript) as their material or function was overtaken by other.


According to Newbould, the exposition and development of the first movement are completely written out, so the recapitulation is based on the exposition, with the pertinent transpositions. Only 11 bars based on earlier transitional material or composed by Newbould were added. As for the coda, his reconstruction became more speculative, but Schubert left a series of modules marked presto which left the overall plan clear. In his opinion, the composer left enough clues so as to decide the correct order of the modules.


For the second movement, Newbould repeated the Fâ¯ major melody (this time in the tonic, B) at the end of the recapitulation, in analogy to the exposition. He also used the coda that Schubert had discarded, since in his view, it had been crossed out in order to restate the melody before.


For the third movement, Newbould reshuffled some sections (as they were not in order in his view), and discarded two of them, which in his opinion had been discarded by Schubert (despite no explicit deletion in the manuscript) as their material or function was overtaken by other sections.


Belgian conductor Pierre BartholomÃ©e viewed Newbould's completion as too respectful and conservative. Subsequently, he reharmonized parts of it to fit his idea of Schubert's late style, and gave more development to contrapuntal entries only indicated in the manuscript. He also gave the winds more prominent roles. He also adds the scherzo from the D 708A symphonic fragment as the third movement. In this aspect, BartholomÃ©e's edition is debatable as the fragment seems to have been conceived by Schubert in a three-movement form, with the third movement combining elements of a Scherzo and a Rondo. Additionally, BartholomÃ©e did not respect the instruments available at Schubert's time, when he wrote for chromatic horns and trumpets.[citation needed]",3,3 June 2007, 23 February 2021,111,0,0

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara. After one of the central streets, it is also called Vojvoda VlahoviÄ, but is also referred to as BraÄe JerkoviÄ II, because it makes urban connection to it. The neighborhood is sometimes also referred to as MedakoviÄ Padina (Serbian Cyrillic: ÐÐµÐ´Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ ÐÐ°Ð´Ð¸Ð½Ð°, transl.âMedakoviÄ Slope).


Padina is located in the south-western section of the municipality, right on the border of the municipality of VoÅ¾dovac, on the northern slope of the 234-metre-tall (768Â ft) hill of MokroluÅ¡ko Brdo, thus the name (Serbian padina, slope). It borders the neighborhoods of MedakoviÄ III on the north, BraÄe JerkoviÄ on the west while on the south-east, through the street of Cvetanova Äuprija, it extends to the neighborhood of Veliki Mokri Lug. On the south it makes one urban section with the neighborhood of BraÄe JerkoviÄ II (or Mitrovo Brdo), where it descends into the KumodraÅ¾ Field, in the valley of the KumodraÅ¡ki Potok stream.


Padina mostly belongs to the local community (administrative sub-municipal unit) of Vojvoda MiÅ¡iÄ, which was formed within the municipality of Zvezdara before the 1991 census. Prior to that, non-urbanized area belonged to Veliki Mokri Lug.


Local community had a population of 2,127 in 1991, 5,520 in 2002 and 6,998 in 2011. This local community includes also parts of the neighborhoods of MedakoviÄ 3 and Cvetanova Äuprija, and in 2020 it was estimated that Zvezdara's part of Padina has 2,500 inhabitants.


However parts of the neighborhood spread outside of the local community, including parts of Veliki Mokri Lug, also in Zvezdara, and Mitrovo Brdo, in the municipality of VoÅ¾dovac. By 2019, it was estimated that the entire neighborhood had a population of 10,000.


The neighborhood originates from the late 1980s. It is a residential area on the edge of the city, spreading from the central street of the same name, Padina, which has been renamed to Veselina ÄajkanoviÄa Street in 2005. Until 2007, mostly individual houses were built, but since then numerous large villas and residential buildings were built on the hills in the outskirts of the neighborhood.


The neighborhood was regularly flooded during heavy rains. In 2018, the partial precipitation sewage system was built in the upper section of the neighborhood, but not in the lower parts, which continued to be flooded. Detailed regulatory plan for the settlement was drafted in 2005, but almost nothing was done of planned projects. All projects, including the full sewage system, are stopped due to the ownership issues and illegally built houses and other structures. By 2021, the neighborhood was still expanding along the upper hills.


Elementary school should be built in the neighborhood in 2022.

Parsons married Anna Dewitt Reed (1858â1958) on May 20, 1884. (She was the daughter of Rev. Sylvanus Reed (1821â1870) and Caroline Gallup Reed (1821â1914). Her brother Sylvanus was the aerospace engineer who developed the modern metal aircraft propeller.) Their children were Sylvia (1885â1962), who married Rudolph Weld (1883â1941) in 1908, and William (1888â1973), who married Rose Peabody (1891â1985), daughter of Endicott Peabody (1857â1944).


Parsons died on May 9, 1932, in New York City.


Parsons worked for the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad from 1882 through 1885. He wrote Turnouts; Exact Formulae for Their Determination (1884) and Track, A Complete Manual of Maintenance of Way (1886) which both addressed railroad problems, and this interest in rail transportation continued throughout his life.


Parsons designed the Cape Cod Canal as Chief Engineer.  He was also Chief Engineer of the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners and was responsible for the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) subway line. He left New York in October 1886 to serve as Chief Engineer for the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railroad, although he retained his affiliation with the District Railway Company. In 1887, he became the Chief Engineer and General Manager of the Denver Railroad and Land and Coal Company. He returned to New York in 1891 upon the completion of these railway projects and a number of water-work ventures in Mississippi.


Parsons was appointed to the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1904 by President Theodore Roosevelt. He was also appointed to the Advisory Board which provided technical advice to the Royal Commission on London Traffic in 1904, along with Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Wolfe-Barry, both British civil engineers. In early 1905, he traveled to Panama as a member of the committee of engineers which favored a sea-level canal.


Parsons was the Colonel of the 11th Engineers of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France during World War I. He was with a team of engineers in Cambrai that was suddenly attacked by Germans while making railroad repairs, and the engineers fought back with picks and shovels. He was cited for ""specially meritorious services"" and received decorations from the United States, Great Britain, France, Belgium, and the state of New York.",0,2 October 2002, 17 September 2021,122,1,1
9581811,Albert VÃ¶gler,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_V%C3%B6gler,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_VÃ¶gler&action=info,"Albert VÃ¶gler (8 February 1877 â 14 April 1945) was a German politician, industrialist and entrepreneur. He was a co-founder of the German People's Party, and an important executive in the munitions industry during the Second World War.


VÃ¶gler was born to Karl and Berta VÃ¶gler in Essen. He studied mechanics and engineering at high school before graduating from the university of Karlsruhe in 1901 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Between 1901 and 1910 he worked as a senior engineer at the Dortmunder Steel Works, and then became a member of the executive committee in the Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks- und HÃ¼tten-AG mining company. Upon the death in 1924 of the founder, Hugo Stinnes, VÃ¶gler became manager.


In 1918, with Gustav Stresemann, he was involved in the founding of the German People's Party (DVP) in the Weimar Republic. He criticised the policies of Joseph Wirth who signed agreements with France in accordance with Germany's submission to the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923. In 1924 he left the DVP.


Between 1925 and 1927 he was a member of the Dortmunder Chamber of Commerce and president of the Rheinisch WestfÃ¤li coal syndicate. In 1926 VÃ¶gler founded the Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG and was its chairman until 1935. In 1927 he also became an honorary board member of his old university in Karlsruhe. He also served as the president of the agricultural company called KWS.


As a business man, VÃ¶gler feared the rise of communism in Germany. Records of donations from VÃ¶gler to the Nazi Party from as early as 1931 exist. VÃ¶gler met Adolf Hitler on 11 September 1931. From 1932 VÃ¶gler openly funded the Nazi party. He was a member of the Freundeskreis Himmler.


Hitler became German Chancellor on 30 January 1933. He held a meeting with Hermann GÃ¶ring, and German industrialists on 20 February 1933. VÃ¶gler was present at this meeting. Hitler presented the Nazi Party's political plans, and received a total of three million marks in donations. During the latter part of the 1930s, VÃ¶gler was described by Jewish businessman Max von der Porten as one of the industrialists who focused primarily on business and hardly speaks of politics and do not want to know anything about it.


From 1940 onwards, VÃ¶gler was heavily involved with the manufacture of munitions. He served in increasingly important positions under Albert Speer in the Ruhr industrial heartland from 1942 until 1944. He helped rationalize armament production and indeed increase production at a time when Germany was clearly losing the war, following the loss of an army at Stalingrad, defeat at the Battle of El Alamein and at the Battle of Kursk. The armaments industry used much forced labour as well as slave labour so costs of manufacture were minimal.


He was president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (later Max Planck Society) from 1941 until his death in 1945.


On 14 April 1945, in order to avoid capture by the US Army, VÃ¶gler committed suicide in Haus Ende, Herdecke. Despite his death, he was still identified as one of the defendants in the Nuremberg trials of prominent industrialists, which prosecuted the clique of businessmen who helped Hitler.",3,18 February 2007, 20 July 2021,97,0,0

In 1935, her Code Letters were changed to KJUD. Pacific Redwood was passed to the United States Maritime Commission in 1937.


In 1940, Pacific Redwood was transferred to the Ministry of Shipping, which became the Ministry of War Transport in 1941. Pacific Redwood was then renamed Empire Chamois. Her port of registry was changed to London. The United Kingdom Official Number 169200 and Code Letters GPJL were allocated. She was placed under the management of the Booth Steamship Co Ltd. Empire Chamois was a member of a number of convoys during the Second World War.


Convoy SC 76 departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 24 March 1942 and arrived at Liverpool on 11 April. Empire Chamois was carrying a cargo of steel bound for Newport, Monmouthshire.

The MoWT became the Ministry of Transport in 1945. In 1946, Empire Chamois's port of registry was changed to Liverpool. On 5 April 1947, Empire Chamois was disabled off Rame Head, Cornwall. She was assisted by HMSÂ Burghead Bay until a tug arrived. Empire Chamois was sold in 1947 to the Astral Shipping Co Ltd. She was renamed Granview and placed under the management of Gouldandris Brothers Ltd, London. In 1949, Granview was sold to the Compagnia Maritime del Este, Panama, remaining under Goulandris's management, but now under the Panamanian Flag and renamed Chamois.

3465621,Brian Wilson (song),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson_(song),https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Wilson_(song)&action=info,"""Brian Wilson"" is a song by Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies from their 1992 album Gordon. The song was written by Steven Page as a tribute to the Beach Boys' co-founder Brian Wilson. It was released as a single and peaked at number 18 on the Canadian Singles Chart. In 1998, the song peaked at number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Wilson himself covered the song on his live album Live at the Roxy Theatre (2000).


The song was written by singer/guitarist Steven Page in his parents' basement around his twentieth birthday, in 1990. The first lines of the song chronicle one of his many late-night journeys to the Sam the Record Man on Yonge Street. The song generally tells the story of a man whose life parallels that of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, particularly during his time spent with psychologist Eugene Landy after Wilson was diagnosed with mental illness, and, more broadly, with lyrics about suffering from comorbid mental illness and obesity.[citation needed]


Steven Page stated in the liner notes for Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits that the song has more ""official"" recordings than any other song in their repertoire, saying that there are at least five. The song was first recorded for the never-released 1990 BNL cassette, Barenaked Recess. After Tyler Stewart joined the band in 1991 as a drummer, it was re-recorded for the band's platinum-selling Yellow Tape, in 1992 for Gordon, in 1996 for the live album Rock Spectacle, and again in 1997 for a version which was called ""Brian Wilson 2000"" and was released as a single.[citation needed]


""Brian Wilson 2000"" is a shortened form of the song for radio play, recorded to sound more like their live performance than the original Gordon version did. The band's management worried that radio stations would not play the live version that had recently gained popularity. The most noticeable differences are that ""2000"" replaces the first verse with an 8-bar instrumental introduction, and the outro is considerably shortened as well. However, most radio stations decided to play the live version instead, which explains why the live version was included on Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits.


The U.S. release included the non-album song ""Back.""


A music video for ""Brian Wilson 2000"" was filmed at The Opera House in Toronto on February 22, 1998 and released later that year.


Wilson rearranged and sang this song a cappella with his new band at live concerts, one of which was recorded for a live album in 2000. Wilson visited Barenaked Ladies while they were recording Maroon (album producer Don Was was an associate of Brian Wilson) whereupon they played him some of their works-in-progress, and then he played them his version of ""Brian Wilson"". At the end, he turned to them and asked, ""Is it cool?"" Upon his departure, his advice to the band was ""don't eat too much."" The band described the entire experience as surreal.


In honour of his covering their song, in recent performances the band has started singing the first chorus a cappella, eliminating all instrumentation, and then continuing the rest of the song with the usual arrangement.[citation needed]

He was born in New York to Roland  and Kitty Hilder (nÃ©e Fissenden). Following the outbreak of World War 1, Hilder's English father decided in 1915 to return to his native county of Kent England to enlist in the army.


Hilder studied at Goldsmiths' College, in south London where he met botanical artist Edith Blenkiron (1903-1992). They married and had two children. As a student with little money he cycled into Kent and discovered the Shoreham Valley in the North Downs where he was delighted to sketch the same barn drawn by the visionary painter Samuel Palmer in the 1820s. This interest in the countryside began a lifelong passion for drawing landscapes in both pencil and watercolour, initially of Kent, ""The Garden of England"", and the Thames with its sailing vessels and old buildings.


Hilder was commissioned by Oxford University Press to illustrate books. His decorative end papers and black and white drawings of ""Treasure Island"" in 1929 won him The Times illustrators award. In the 1930s he illustrated several books. In 1929 Hilder was commissioned by Shell Mex Ltd to illustrate ""Then and Now"", a travel guide which started a long relationship with the company with posters sponsored by them. In 1953 when asked by the publisher George Rainbird to provide background landscapes to a series of wildflowers by another artist, Hilder showed him pictures of flowers by his wife Edith. Rainbird then commissioned them both to create the Shell ""Flowers of the Countryside"" series. Demand was so great that Shell set up an office to deal with correspondence and 13 million plates were published.


He was also a cover artist for Radio Times and, together with Edith, illustrated the Ladybird Book of British Wild Flowers published in 1957.


He has been called 'the Turner of his generation', and according to the Dictionary of National Biography 'The description ""Rowland Hilder country"" (attached primarily to the weald of Kent) evokes a landscape as distinctive and personal as ""Constable's country"" along the Suffolk Stour.'


He was an army Camouflage Officer during the Second World War and then became a mainstay of the Ministry of Information.[citation needed]

It was named after Whitney Straight, a Grand Prix motor racing driver, aviator and businessman. The aircraft was the first combine a side-by-side seating arrangement with an enclosed cockpit for the general aviation sector.


The Whitney Straight was developed after F.G. Miles and Straight recognised that they had similar ambitions to develop modern aircraft suited to flying clubs and private owners alike, and thus decided to collaborate on its production. On 14 May 1936, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight at Woodley Aerodrome; quantity production commenced shortly thereafter. Whitney Straights were used in various roles within the civil market, such as air racing and aerial topdressing.


Approaches were also made by Miles to introduce the Whitney Straight into the military market. While not selected as an army cooperation aircraft for the British Army in the pre-war years, numerous civil aircraft were impressed into military service during the Second World War, the type being largely operated as a communications aircraft. While production ended in 1937, several Whitney Straights remained in an airworthy condition into the twenty first century.


During late 1935, the Grand Prix motor racing driver, aviator and businessman Whitney Straight was engaged in efforts to establish numerous flying clubs to server major British towns. As a part of his efforts to popularise aviation, Straight sought a modern aeroplane that would be best suited for both club flying and use by private owners; specifically, he desired the envisioned aircraft to be considerably faster that the slow moving biplanes that traditionally dominated the market. It was also desirable for such a plane to feature a side-by-side seating arrangement in an enclosed cockpit, rather than an open cockpit that necessitated the cumbersome use of speaking tubes, in addition to more general attributes such as being reasonably easy to handle, safe to fly, and economic to both maintain and operate.


By this point, F.G. Miles of Philips and Powis had already established a favourable reputation due to, amongst other feats, the company's aircraft having been front runners in the King's Cup Race, thus the company was viewed by Straight as a natural partner for his envisioned aircraft. Upon being approached by Straight, Miles concurred with his aims, thus the two decided to collaborate on the development and marketing of such an aircraft, which was designated as the M.11 Whitney Straight. Work on the project proceeded at a relatively rapid pace, enabling the first prototype (G-AECT) to conduct its maiden flight at Woodley Aerodrome on 14 May 1936. Initially piloted by F.G. Miles, the prototype demonstrated the design to already be fulfilling expectations, particularly in regards to its ease of flight and comfort, while also achieving a 50 percent speed increase over its biplane contemporaries.


Having been sufficiently pleased with the first prototype's early performance, quantity production of the Whitney Straight commenced as soon as possible, a state which was reportedly achieved by April 1936. Seeking to promote the type, F.G. Miles personally performed an intense tour around Europe to demonstrate and promote the Whitney Straight to potential customers; amongst the feats of the tour was a 17,000ft flight above the Alps without the use of a supercharger-equipped engine. During April 1938, production of the type was terminated, by which point a total of 50 Whitney Straights had been completed.


The Miles M.11 Whitney Straight was a twin-seat monoplane specifically built for use by flying clubs and private owners. Its construction was primarily composed of wood, including spruce frames and three-ply birch covering.  The Whitney Straight featured a fixed main undercarriage complete with aerodynamic fairings, along with a fixed tailwheel. Relatively comfortable accommodation for its pilot, a single passenger and their luggage, was provided within an enclosed 'side-by-side' cockpit. The cockpit was covered by a single-piece canopy comprising molded Perspex.


The wings of the Whitney Straight were relatively thick for the era; considerable effort had been put into their design to carefully define their drag properties. The wings were fitted with vacuum-operated split flaps; these were attributed as having enabled the type's relatively low takeoff speed of 50 mph, as well as the aircraft's high rate of climb. An alternative flap arrangement, that was noticeably more efficient and produced less drag while increasing lift coefficient, was experimented with during the later years of the prototype's flying career; it directly influenced the design of several subsequent aircraft.


While early production aircraft were powered by a single 130Â hp (97Â kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major I piston engine, alternative powerplants, such as the Villiers Maya and Menasco Pirate engines, were also used. While a fixed-pitch propeller was used on most aircraft, at least one aircraft was furnished with a variable-pitch propeller that, amongst other benefits, further shortened the takeoff distance required and boosted its initial rate of climb.


The Whitney Straight was routinely promoted as possessing a high level of safety, largely as a consequence of its favourable handling characteristics. F.G. Miles frequently performed relatively dramatic demonstrations to validate this claim, closing the throttle while in a steep climb and releasing the controls for the aircraft to return to level flight of its own accord after only a steep dive. Even when flown at relatively low altitudes, its recovery abilities were impressive.


Numerous Whitney Straights participated in air racing events; in the 1937 King's Cup Race alone, one of the type placed second, while another came in fourth. Several Whitney Straights were also modified as engine test beds, as well as to test different flap designs.


On 28 June 1938, the sole M.11C (G-AEYI) to be built crashed at Harefield, Berkshire, resulting in the death of its test pilot, Wing Commander F.W. Stent.[citation needed]


Efforts were made by Miles to promote the Whitney Straight to military customers, including its pre-war submission as an army cooperation aircraft for the British Army. Shortly following the outbreak of the Second World War, the Air Ministry impressed 23 Whitney Straights into military service, in which capacity they were operated as communications aircraft. Twenty-one such aircraft were based in Britain, while one was stationed in India, and another in Egypt. At least one M.11A also served with the Fleet Air Arm between 1940 and 1943, while three were reportedly used by  the Royal New Zealand Air Force.


Between 1939 and 1943, a New Zealand-based aircraft, piloted by Alan Prichard, participated in aerial seed sowing trials at Ninety Mile Beach, and was subsequently used for spreading superphosphate. These trials were part of the experiments which led to the development of aerial topdressing and the proliferation of aircraft for agricultural purposes.


While not produced in large numbers, examples of the type have frequently had particularly lengthy operating lives. At least one aircraft remained in an airworthy condition.

41223657,Mataano,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mataano,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mataano&action=info,"Mataano  (""Twins"" in the Somali language) is a women's fashion line. Founded in 2008, it is owned by Somali-American twin fashion designers Ayaan and Idyl Mohallim. The brand is noted for its global sensibility and accent on ready-to-wear elegance.


Ayaan and Idyl Mohallim were born in Alabama to Somali parents.  They moved to Somalia at an early age, where they would spend their first nine years. When the civil war broke out there in the early 1990s, they returned to the United States.


Settling in northern Virginia, just outside Washington D.C., the sisters developed an interest in fashion after their mother would buy them fashion magazines. Their family put an emphasis on education, envisioning the girls' studying at top schools in preparation for professional careers. Upon graduation from college, the twins moved to New York City to pursue their goal of becoming fashion designers. Idyl quickly secured an internship with Betsey Johnson, where she acquired skills in design technique and color. Ayaan also landed a production job at Jill Stuart. There, she in turn learned how to infuse classic forms and vintage fabrics with a contemporary flair.


Mataano specializes in contemporary read-to-wear pieces for women. It began mainly with dress production, with an accent on comfort. Plans were also in the works to branch out into other areas.


To establish a foothold in the fashion market, Ayaan and Idyl focused on ensuring their wear was ready for distribution. They then retained the services of a PR firm to help them advertise their brand, in the process sending out press releases and look books, as well as establishing a website. Their marketing efforts eventually earned the designers an invitation to the Oprah Winfrey Show to Skype with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. The Mohallim sisters have also been invited to showcase in Sweden, South Africa, Jamaica and at New York Fashion Week.


Mataano showcased its premier collection for Spring 2009 in New York City. Consisting of ten dresses, it attracted widespread attention in the fashion industry and received enthusiastic reviews. The brand has since launched six other collections during New York Fashion Week.


The Somali filmmaker Idil Ibrahim later directed Mataano's official promotional video for the fashion line's 2009 Fall collection. She likewise directed the official promotional video for the company's 2010 Spring collection.


In Spring 2012, supermodel and fellow Somali Iman also signed Ayaan and Idyl as brand ambassadors for her cosmetics line.


Mataano is noted for its global sensibility and emphasis on elegance. The Mohallim twins strive to incorporate their experiences and influences as Somali Americans into their designs, reflecting both cultures in their work. Mataano's Spring 2013 collection in part drew inspiration from Los Angeles' beaches, featuring light silks and organzas. According to co-founder Ayaan, the sisters ultimately design for the multicultural woman like themselves. The silks and colorful hues that adorn the fashion line are consequently typical of Somali female attire.


In terms of other fashion designers, Ayaan and Idyl's primary influences include Tracy Reese and Carolina Herrera, whom they feel have an international appeal. They also admire the work of Donna Karen and Oscar de la Renta.


As of 2013, Mataano is designed and manufactured in New York City.",3,29 November 2013, 14 June 2021,36,0,0
