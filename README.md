# ML-practice
Files and Jupyter notebooks representing some of the things I've learned as I develop skills in Machine Learning with Python.

ðŸš§ Most of the files herein are a work in progress, reflecting my journey as a student and my growing knowledge. ðŸš§

## Folders in this repository
* `Deep learning`: PyTorch code for building and training neural networks.
* `Vehicle specs`: contains code for an end-to-end machine learning pipeline: collecting data, processing and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis, extracting features from unstructured data (text and images), and applying supervised and unsupervised ML models for statistical inference.
* `1000 Wikipedia Articles`: code for data collection; using Wikipedia's API and webscraping to gather extensive data on any number of Wikipedia articles, with numeric, text, and categorical features for running classification, regression, or clustering models.
* `Other`: collection of notebooks and scripts for miscellaneous data analysis.
