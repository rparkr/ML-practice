# ML-practice
Files and Jupyter notebooks I've created as I develop skills in Machine Learning with Python. 

As of Dec-2021, the `Vehicle specs` folder has code for collecting data, processing and cleaning the data, EDA, extracting features from unstructured data (text and images), and applying supervised and unsupervised ML models for statistical inference.

The `1000 Wikipedia Articles` folder has Python code to gather extensive data on any number of Wikipedia articles, with numeric, text, and categorical features for running classification, regression, or clustering models.
