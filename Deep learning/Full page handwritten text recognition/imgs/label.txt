studies. I learned a lot too - about how to develop charity (Moroni 8:25-26 AND Mosiah 4:11-13), about
attributes of good leaders (I studied w/ that question as well as how to work with members better), about
how covenanting with God brings power, peace, security, and joy. I read a lot of truly inspiring scriptures. In my
study of PMG, I realized that that manual comes from God in every way and is exactly how He wants His work
to be carried out in these days. It's remarkable. I realized that many of the points about working w/ members
that we learned on Fri. come directly from its pages. I also learned how God teaches me line upon line, little
by little - He prepares me to recieve light and truth and knowledge in His time and in His way so I can best
learn. It has been that way with so many things I have learned lately - experiences I have, passages I study,
things others say to me or my family writes to me - all received in the perfect moment so I can learn and progress
and understand God's will and His ways. <INSERT>Another thing I learned: I read my Patriarchal Blessing and I felt the Spirit
testifying of the truth of every paragraph and filling me with hope and
comfort.<\INSERT>
    We washed our clothes, hung them to dry, got our hair cut, bought groceries, made lunch and showered, and
I began a fast. I am fasting for 3 things:
    1. Humility (esp. recognize weaknesses and overcome them through Christ's atonement)
    2. To do God's work in His way - not mine or anyone else's (yieldidng my heart to Him - <INSERT>not trusting in
my arm, but His<\INSERT>)
    3. To learn to use and manage my time wisely.
    We then wrote Pte. and our families, and I began to pack, but I took too long and finished at around 9:45,
when I was supposed to be at the Orange House at 7pm. I'll go tomorrow instead. I feel bad for failing
my 1st assignment.
    Well, I'm happy my Fast will help me humbly accept God's will and work and give my whole heart to
Him in my new assignment. I know He will consecrate my fast for what is best for me and for the progress of
His work and glory.
    My good companion has done a ton of service for me today too. | <INSERT>Oh, and the weather was great, with
sun rays through the clouds too<\INSERT>
    So, how do I feel? Nervous, a bit overwhelmed, but confident in God's promises. I know that I
cannot fulfill or magnify my calling on my own. But <INSERT>if<\INSERT> I give myself to God, He can magnify me and
lift me to rise to the height needed to accomplish His great work. I love Him, and want to do and
serve my best for His honor and glory.                Goodnight! (10:29pm)
    Afterwards I prayed with E. Zavala - our last night-time companion prayer w/ E. Zavala - and I prayed personally,
and I went to bed at 10:50. I am so grateful that I fell asleep so quickly and never had problems going to
sleep or sleeping well.
