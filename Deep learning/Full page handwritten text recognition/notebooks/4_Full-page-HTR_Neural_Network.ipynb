        "* Research goals that this paper addressed:\n",
        " - Multi-paragraph text detection in proper sequence\n",
        " - Capture indentation\n",
        " - Ignore scratched-out text, math, tables, or unrecognized symbols\n",
        " - Use character-level generation to avoid the constraint of a language model (with a fixed vocabulary size)\n",
        "* Prior to performing image-to-sequence extraction, you need to convert the image from grayscale to black-and-white (to assist in focusing on the text)\n",
        "* This method is called \"offline handwritten text recognition (HTR)\", which means the input is an image of text. In contrast, \"online HTR\" means that the input is pen strokes, with directional and timing data, such as what could be obtained from a digital stylus on a Microsoft Surface or Apple iPad.\n",
        "* You can include special sequence tags like `<deleted text>` or `<side note>` and the model can learn to recognize those regions\n",
        "* \"If you added a Transformer at the end of the CNN encoder, it would probably increase accuracy, but we found it wasn't necessary and model size was too large with a Transformer encoder as well\"\n",
        "* \"You don't need line-number encodings in the decoder, if you omit them, your model will perform almost as well.\"\n",
        "* \"Decoder uses local attention, though Transformers commonly use global attention. We found that local attention didn't reduce efficacy and trained faster, since we could use larger batch sizes.\"\n",
        "* \"We didn't use beam search\"\n",
        "* \"We used ResNet34 for the encoder, which has 21M parameters. You could use any CNN, though. We did not use the pre-trained version and trained ours from scratch.\"\n",
        "* \"Inference takes 4.6 seconds per page on a CPU thread, when the input image is 2500x2200 pixels with 456 characters and 11.65 lines.\"\n",
        "* \"Decoder is a Transformer with 6M parameters. We use cross-entropy loss, dropout, and cross attention on the entire image.\"\n",
        "* \"The longest part, where we spent the most time, was preparing the data to use for model training. Ideally, you want 100k samples. We had about 20k after augmenting our proprietary 13k samples. We also used WikiText rendered in over 300 fonts, with varying degrees of skewness, text layout on page, contrast, brightness, and blank images. You really need a lot of data to train these models on. The goal is to have a large enough sample base that it is independent and identically distributed, so mini-batch samples all reflect roughly the same (identical) data distribution.\"\n",
        "* \"Model doesn't perform well on out-of-distribution data.\"\n",
        "* \"The model is sensitive to image padding\"\n",
        "* Encoder takes up a lot of parameters, potentially an improvement area would be creating a more efficient encoder.\n",

        "* \"During training, weights are 32 bits, gradients are 16 bits\"\n",

        "To save periodic checkpoints, create a checkpoint dictionary with at least the `model.state_dict()` and `optimizer.state_dict()` as entries in the dictionary. You may also want to include entries for `epoch`, `loss`, or `nn.Embedding()` layers that occur outside of the main `model`. Next, use `torch.save(checkpoint_dict, filepath)` with a `.pt` or `.pth` extension in `filepath` and the saved file will be a serialized dictionary that holds all the information you wanted to capture.\n",
        "\n",
        "To load the saved checkpoint, use `checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_filepath)`, then intitialize the model and optimizer as normal, then do `model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])` to load the parameters and registered buffers (like BatchNorm mean) into the model. Similarly, run `optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optim_state_dict'])` to load the optimizer's parameters into the initialized optimizer instance. Notice how the saved `state_dict()` is simply a value in a dictionary that is accessed with the keys 'model_state_dict' or 'optim_state_dict'. The `torch.load()` function takes the saved checkpoint file and loads it back into a Python dictionary.\n",
